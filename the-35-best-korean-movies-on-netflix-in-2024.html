Jeon Jong-seo and Park Shin-hye, respectively, play those two main characters, who can contact each other 10 years apart through a cordless phone in the house where they each spent their respective childhoods. Though their calls start helpful, with each giving the other enough information to improve their lives, things quickly take a turn, with the killer taking advantage of their multi-year connection to commit murders without attracting police attention and, ultimately, kill her long-distance phone pal. Though the movie seemingly closes on a happy ending, be sure to stick around for the two end credits scenes for the full story.</p><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.netflix.com/title/81342505 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url=https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/100577549/type/dlg/sid/hawk-custom-tracking/https://www.netflix.com/title/81342505 data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=netflix.com data-merchant-id=1070 data-merchant-url=netflix.com data-merchant-network=CJ>WATCH NOW</a></p><h2 id=39-the-chase-39-2017-3>'The Chase' (2017)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqucaG4fTonpFi5hLKJnhE-1920-80.jpg><p>This 2017 crime film stars a pair of unlikely heroes investigating a serial killer in the town of Aridong.
