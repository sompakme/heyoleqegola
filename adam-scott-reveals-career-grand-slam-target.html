Scott’s only Major win to date came in the 2013 Masters. At that point, he was only 32, and the following year, he became World No.1, which suggested it might be a matter of time until he added to his tally.&nbsp;</p><p>However, while another Major win has failed to materialise so far, the 42-year-old still thinks he can win the remaining three. Speaking before this week’s tournament at Royal Queensland, he said: “I guess I wanted to win all the Majors, and that sounds like a lot, but really it’s three more events. It’s just got to be the right week. I have all the tools. I’m still very healthy. I’m still moving the golf ball well, and I have a lot of experience, and I’m just trying to put it all together.”</p><p>Scott has certainly come close to more Major wins, suggesting that if he can recover his best form, he can achieve his ambition. Following his win at <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.golfmonthly.com/travel/usa/how-can-i-play-augusta-national-66516>Augusta National</a>, Scott tied for fourth at the 2015 US Open before tying for third in the 2018 PGA Championship. He also finished runner-up in the Open in 2012.&nbsp;</p><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.golfmonthly.com/news/adam-scott-reunites-with-former-caddie-as-he-eyes-second-major-win>Scott has also reunited with Steve Williams</a>, the caddie he had for his Masters win nine years ago. With the tweaked setup in place, the World No.34 seems determined to make the most of his remaining competitive years. He said: “I don’t live in the States, but I’m going to spend way more time in the States next year to compete seriously. I can’t be flying all around the world playing against guys who don’t.&nbsp;</p><p>"I’ve shifted my focus as well. I want to fulfil my dreams and goals as a player and time is less and less on my side. I have to do everything I can to make sure I give myself the best chance. I still haven’t achieved all the things I want to achieve in my own career.”</p><p>Check out the Golf Monthly website for all the latest news, reviews and the best&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.golfmonthly.com/best-golf-deals/black-friday-golf-deals-142950>Black Friday golf deals</a>&nbsp;as we approach Christmas.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLvLn6SopqSdubp6wqikaKaVrMBwrcOapGark6TBtXnRnq2emZyoeqSt0Z6cq2WXp66vsIyso5qlXamus7PErQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
