Omos&nbsp;<a href=#>has some surprising supporters&nbsp;</a>and that’s not really a surprise anymore for him. He has been absent for a long time and now it seems he made his in-ring return after almost two months during a recent WWE live event.</p><p>Omos&nbsp;signed with WWE in January 2019 and eventually got paired up with AJ Styles in 2020, going on to win the RAW Tag Team Championships at WrestleMania 37.&nbsp;Omos had two high profile matches this year – notably with Brock Lesnar and Seth Rollins at WrestleMania 39 and Backlash respectively.</p><p>It is to be noted that he is currently a free agent. His last televised appearance was during the Battle Royal at SummerSlam and since then, Omos has largely been competing at live events. After 55 days, Omos finally competed in a match against Akira Tozawa at the WWE SuperShow live event in Rochester, New York, where he would demolish Tozawa.</p><p>We will have to wait and see when Omos will make his return to WWE television, as the company does not seem to have any major plans for The Nigerian Nightmare at the moment.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>What do you think of Omos finally competing in a match after almost two months?
