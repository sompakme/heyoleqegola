Finishing off your routine with an oil or adding a few drops of one to your favorite moisturizers can transform your <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>nightly ritual</a> into a relaxing, spa-like experience. While there are a ton of facial oils out there suited for different skin types and needs, few are as hyped up as rosehip oil.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Rich in vitamin A and essential fatty acids, the oil can be used to treat visible signs of aging, acne scars, dullness, and inflammation. It's also been said to help heal acne. No wonder <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kate Middleton</a>, skincare Reddit, and thousands of Amazon customers are fans.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But what makes this multitasking oil so effective? We turned to a top dermatologist and aesthetician to find out all of rosehip oil's benefits and how to use the ingredient in your skincare routine.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-does-rosehip-oil-work></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Does Rosehip Oil Work?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Due to its small molecular structure, rosehip oil has the ability to penetrate the deep layers of the skin to stimulate collagen and reduce fine lines and wrinkles," explains <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Dr. Michele Green</a>, a cosmetic dermatologist in New York City. "It is also full of antioxidants and has moisturizing benefits due to its high percentage of fatty acids — a whopping 80% to be exact."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Rosehip oil contains vitamin A (also found in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>retinol</a>, the holy grail of anti-aging products), E, C, and omega fatty acids 3,6, and 9, which promote skin cell turnover, skin elasticity, and improve the appearance of hyperpigmentation.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Essential acids linolenic (omega-3) and linoleic (omega-6), make rosehip are known for strengthening the skin barrier function (essential for retaining moisture) and boosting collagen (maintains firmness).</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-whats-the-difference-between-rosehip-oil-and-rosehip-seed-oil></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What's the Difference Between Rosehip Oil and Rosehip Seed Oil?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Essentially, rosehip oil and rosehip seed oil are one in the same and both safe to use on skin. However, it's important to note that they're different from rose oil.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Rose oil is extracted from rose petals, while rosehip or rosehip seed oil is made from pressing the small berry/fruit that lies underneath the rose flower," says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Sofie Pavitt</a>, an aesthetician in NYC.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-do-you-use-rosehip-oil></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Do You Use Rosehip Oil?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Pavitt recommends massaging a few drops of rosehip oil into your face as the last step in your skincare routine. "This oil will leave your skin feeling smooth, hydrated, and nourished," she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since rosehip oil is a dry oil, Dr. Green agrees it should be applied at the end of your skincare routine following all of your water-based products. "Due to its moisturizing benefits you can opt to skip added moisturizer, especially in the summertime, but don't skimp on applying sunscreen," she says. "During colder months you can adjust this routine by adding a moisturizer after your rosehip oil."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Your skin will feel immediately smooth and nourished, but Pavitt says you see the full benefits of rosehip oil after six to eight weeks of use.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: When You Apply Sunscreen in Your Skincare Routine Actually Matters A Lot</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-are-the-side-effects-of-rosehip-oil></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Are the Side Effects of Rosehip Oil?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While rosehip oil boasts an impressive list of skincare benefits and is generally safe for all skin types, it's always best to err on the side of caution when adding any new product into your skincare routine — especially since it's an essential oil, which can be irritating for some.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"You should apply a small amount of the oil to your inner arm to test for any allergic reaction," says Dr. Green. "If there is no reaction after 24 hours you can proceed with applying to your face."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to doing a patch test, Pavitt says acne-prone skin types may find that the oil exacerbates breakouts, even though the oil is said to help clear pimples. She also notes that because rosehip oil contains vitamin A, it's wise not use it in conjunction with retinol products.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Curious about experiencing the benefits of rosehip oil firsthand?
