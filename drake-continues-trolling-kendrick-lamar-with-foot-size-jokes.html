On the song "Push Ups," he took shots at numerous superstars who have criticized him in recent weeks. That mainly focused on Kendrick Lamar, Metro Boomin, and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Rick Ross</a> but is also rumored to include <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Future</a> and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>The Weeknd</a>. Fans got to hear the song and break down all of it's lyrics for almost a week before it was officially released. Earlier today, the song finally hit streaming services.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Drake took to his Instagram story where he announced the songs release on Spotify and Apple Music. Unsurprisingly, he used the announcement as yet another opportunity to take a shot at Kendrick Lamar. “All platforms like the shoes you need… let’s get it bro.” the caption of his announcement reads. The song's artwork also hilarious features the mark of a size seven shoe. Both the caption and art are references to a lyric in the song where he takes shots at Kendrick for his height and shoe size. Check out the announcement he made below.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-drake-cracks-joke-about-kendrick-lamar-needing-platform-shoes>Drake Cracks Joke About Kendrick Lamar Needing Platform Shoes</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Throughout the beef, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Joe Budden</a> has been calling together podcast episodes to break down every new development.
