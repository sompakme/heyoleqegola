He becomes the 10th player to reach the milestone for Ireland, following in the footsteps of flyhalf Jonathan Sexton, scrumhalf Conor Murray and winger Keith Earls, who are all in the matchday 23 against Scotland.</p><p>“There’s no better man you’d want sat alongside you than Peter O’Mahony,” Farrell said. “He’s a selfless player who gives everything to his teammates and backs that up with consistent performances week in, week out.”</p><p>Sexton seconded that, and added that his friend is a somewhat mysterious figure.</p><p>“He’s very different to some of the other leaders. You don’t get to see the real Peter O’Mahony, he gives very little away in public,” Sexton said. “But he’s the life and soul of the group behind closed doors.”</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>Centers Bundee Aki and Garry Ringrose start their 24th test together, while Ryan and Kelleher are both on the bench.</p><p>The Scots are in confident mood after their B side routed Romania 84-0.

The first three or four lineouts (against South Africa) didn’t go the way we wanted,” Henderson said. “Scotland have a good lineout defense, we know it’s a big area they will look to target.
