Teigen, who was a budding model at the time, starred as Legend’s love interest in the video and later revealed that there was a spark between them off-screen. “We did the music video. We were together for like 12 hours,” she&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told Wendy Williams</a>&nbsp;during an interview in 2014. “We spent the entire day together, me in my underwear and him in a full suit, and I went to go say goodbye to him, to his hotel, and we didn’t ever say goodbye that night.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But they didn't immediately start dating. "I left him by himself for a while," Teigen previously revealed to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Cosmopolitan</a>. "The worst thing you can do is try to lock someone like that down early on, then have them think, 'There's so much more out there.' I played it cool for a long time.

He was like, ‘I can’t be in a relationship right now.’ That lasted for one day. Literally, a day. I knew it came from a place other than us not working. It was the stress of him having to maybe cancel a show, and he had never been in a real relationship—or so he says now. I always joke, ‘Remember when you tried to break up with me?’ He’s like, ‘Yes, sorry.&nbsp;Big&nbsp;mistake.'”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>February 2008: Chrissy Teigen and John Legend make their red carpet debut at the Grammys.</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Legend and Teigen made their red carpet debut at the 2008 Grammy Awards — and like most throwback photos, the cookbook author looks back and laughs: "Grammys 2008. 10 years ago. This tan!!! Lmao," she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>captioned</a> a snap of the couple from the award show.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>December 2011: Chrissy Teigen and John Legend are engaged.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">John proposed to Chrissy during their holiday trip to the Maldives, but things didn't go exactly according to plan.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“[The ring] was in my carry-on bag going through airport security, and security wanted to look through my bag, and they wanted to look in that particular box,” Legend said during a 2013 appearance on&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Oprah’s Next Chapter</a>. “And Chrissy was standing right next to me, and I was, like, ‘Oh, my God. I’ve hidden it so well this whole time. Now as we’re just about to get to the Maldives, she’s going to find out I have a ring in this box, and it’s going to ruin the surprise, and I’ll have to get on my knees in the airport.'”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Luckily, he didn't have to propose in the security line at the airport.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Chrissy chimed in, “We get to the Maldives, and he had planned this beautiful Christmas. He knows how much I love Christmas…And this waiter comes out with a silver dome for dessert…So he opens up the dome, and a ton of arugula falls out, and then I kind of fish in it…And I see the little box, and then you know, your heart stops, and you get so excited," adding: "There was no big grand speech or anything. I think it was just very lovely and sweet.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>August 2013: John Legend releases his song "All of Me" about Chrissy Teigen.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In perhaps the greatest romantic grand gesture of all time, Legend released his song "All of Me" in honor of Teigen. "The first line of it is, 'What would I do without your smart mouth,' so if that's not about me, I don't know what is," Chrissy told the&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Huffington&nbsp;Post</a> at the time. "I did cry when I heard it. I'm emotional, but like I don't really cry at things like that, so yeah, it was beautiful. And live, it's pretty unreal." She later starred in the single's music video, which included footage from their Lake Como wedding at the end.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>September 2013: Chrissy Teigen and John Legend are married.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On September 10, 2013, Chrissy and John got married at the courthouse in New York City (model Irina Shayk was their witness), days before their wedding in Lake Como, Italy, on the 14th. At their second ceremony, Legend serenaded Teigen, who was clad in multiple Vera Wang gowns, with the song "All of Me."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>December 2015: Chrissy Teigen and John Legend announce they are expecting their first child.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Teigen <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>revealed</a> that she and Legend were going to be first-time parents after having difficulty conceiving.

Chrissy added, "Every appointment, I’ve said to myself, 'ok, if it’s healthy today, I’ll announce,' but then I breathe a sigh of relief to hear a heartbeat and decide I’m just too nervous still.

You just grow, and you mature. Part of it is it's just a matter of time.
