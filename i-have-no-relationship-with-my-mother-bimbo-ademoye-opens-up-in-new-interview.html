You know, like when you have your first monthly flow, he’s just as shocked as you are.

But that’s about what we have. And I think I’m very okay with that. I’m okay with the no friendship, no closeness zone that we’re in for my mental health and for my own sanity. I’m very much okay with it. But my mum is very much alive. Very beautiful, dark-skinned, robust, chubby. I got my hips from my mum and my waist from my mother as well.
