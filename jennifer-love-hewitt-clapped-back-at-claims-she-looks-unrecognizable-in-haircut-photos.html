During a recent appearance on the Inside of You podcast, the actress chatted with host ​​Michael Rosenbaum about the incident while lamenting about the difficulties that come with aging in Hollywood.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Aging in Hollywood is really hard. You can't do anything right,” she shared before getting candid about the infamous photo, which she originally shared back in August. “I was getting my hair done and I had not a stitch of makeup on, so, I threw on a filter. I really gave it no thought.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>instagram/jennifer love hewitt</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She then recalled how the photo quickly blew up on social media, adding, “A bunch of people were like, ‘Jennifer Love Hewitt is unrecognizable.' ‘She's unrecognizable, so she's gone to filters because she doesn't want us to know how bad she actually looks now in her 40s.' This is crazy, right?”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hewitt explained that she responded to the backlash by “trying to make fun of it” by sharing even more snaps featuring “over-the-top” filters — complete with the cheeky caption, “So many people said I look different. I look the same as always. Couldn't look more natural ... Filters don't change you that much.”&nbsp; — but that didn’t go over too well, either.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I was like, ‘All natural, no filter,’ like trying to make fun of it, and then they came after me for that and they were like, ‘Well, now she's just defending herself and why is she defending?’” she said. “I realized I can do no right.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When asked by Rosenbaum why she wastes any of her time focusing on trolls “who have nothing better to do than put you down,” Jennifer replied, “because to pretend that we don’t is a lie.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She concluded, “You don’t want to care what people think about you, but you have to care what people think about you.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57yZ6lp6GWmr9uuM6vnGaglay2tcCMnKOaqKCasW6uwJyiZpuclrauv4ysn55lnKS8rL%2BMrqWrnZOktK%2B12ZqZpZ1dbYFyg5hwbA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
