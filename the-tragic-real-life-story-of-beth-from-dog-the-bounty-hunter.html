The Chapman family's attorney, Andrew R. Brettler, confirmed the treatment method to <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> in January 2018, stating that Beth had begun the treatments the month before.</p><p>"[The treatments] are going well, but they certainly take their toll on her," Brettler said, adding, "[It] hasn't been easy but they are keeping a great outlook and Beth is one of the strongest women I know." Beth also seemingly confirmed the reports about her treatment with the above <a href=#>Instagram selfie</a> that included the hashtags "#cancersucks #stayhumblepray #itsonlyhair."</p><p>However, by May 2019, Beth "seemingly alluded to having stopped chemotherapy treatments," according to <a href=#>People</a>. The outlet reported that during a speech on Mother's Day at the Source Church in Bradenton, Fla., Beth said, "Chemotherapy is not my bag, people. Sorry, that's not for me." She went on to describe her cancer battle as "the ultimate test of faith," but she did not elaborate more on her health or alternative treatments at the time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxhaX11e9OhnGasopa0qq%2BMq5yapF2htqexjKyrqKqpYrynecGeq6Fllqe8rnnDqJ5mrJiaeqO71KersmWYqru1sdFo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
