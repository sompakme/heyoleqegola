Captain Emerson’s defense team is crafting a release plan and expect that he will finally return home to his family by the end of this week.”</p><p>Emerson pleaded not guilty. He is being held at the Multnomah County Detention Center, according to Schmidt, and is scheduled to be arraigned on Thursday morning.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop><p>Speaking to <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>The New York Times</a> from prison last month, Emerson explained that he had taken psychedelic mushrooms for the first time two days before the incident during a weekend trip in which he gathered with friends to commemorate the death of his own best friend.</p><p>At the time, the flight was en route to San Francisco from Everett, Washington, but was forced to divert to Portland, Oregon, as Emerson experienced his mid-flight meltdown.</p><p>The off-duty pilot, who was seated in the cockpit jump seat when he tried to shut off the engines, said he was still in a hallucinogenic state as the plane took off, adding he had not dealt with longstanding mental health issues.</p><p>The Times noted the difficulty for pilots struggling with such issues, facing potential grounding by their airline if they seek psychiatric help. In an email to the Times, Alaska Airlines, who Emerson works for as a pilot, said that “more can be done” to support pilot mental health.</p><p>Emerson claimed he texted a friend while on the flight saying he was having a “panic attack,” and that he thought he was dead or dreaming. He yelled at the pilots for help, but said he was convinced that if he shut the engines of the plane off, he would wake up.</p><p>After a struggle with the pilots of the plane, Emerson was taken into custody, where he recalled stripping naked, trying to jump out a window, urinating on himself, and even attempting to ejaculate in an attempt to wake up as he was being interviewed by cops and held in a cell at the airport.</p><p>It took him five days to finally sober up, he claimed. “I am horrified that those actions put myself at risk and others at risk.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEnZiipKmXsqK%2F02eaqKVfpLOnecOuq7JlkaGutLfAZpiiqpyeu6a%2FjKmgpaekYsSpu4ytqaKdlGLBsHnSoaytZZ%2Bbs26xzaCgp52jYrqqsIyfo6KfmKl6pr%2FCmqeeq12WwbWxzKmrnpxdosKzsMSrZJygkae0pr8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
