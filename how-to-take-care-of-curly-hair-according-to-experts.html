One day we've got bouncy, defined curls, and the next, a shapeless mass of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>frizz and flyaways</a>. So what gives? According to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Marilisa Sears</a>, a celebrity hairstylist and the artistic director at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>Marc Anthony</a>, "The first rule of curl club is that the rules changeâ€¦ constantly. What works today may not work tomorrow or ever again." That's because curly hair is nuanced, which means it needs a special kind of TLC. As a result, there are certain guidelines to follow to bring out the best of your curls.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From hacks every curl pattern can do to specific styling advice for your hair type, keep reading for how to take care of curls, straight from curly hair specialists.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-1-wash-curly-hair-at-least-once-a-week></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>1. Wash Curly Hair at Least Once a Week</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Naturally textured hair should be cleaned at least once weekly to maintain a healthy scalp and hair," says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Dre Demry-Sanders</a>, a professional hairstylist and self-proclaimed texture advocate. "The cleansing process is the most important part of any hair care routine as it provides the hair with the best and most effective source of moisture and establishes a blank slate for a styling product to work most efficiently."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"When washing, it's important to make sure your hair is completely wet before adding some of the shampoos to the palms of your hands and lather it up," adds Sears. "Get in deep with your fingertips to help shake the dirt out and if you don't have a lot of product build-up, gently massage the shampoo into the rest of the hair before rinsing to give the hair a gentle cleanse."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Curly hair is prone to dryness, which is why once a week is typically a good balance for holding on to the hair's natural oils without causing any other hair concerns. Depending on your scalp type (i.e. if you are dry or oily), you may be able to get away with washing less or more frequently. That said, a general rule of thumb to follow is to wash weekly to avoid product build-up or excessive oil production.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Sebum is a naturally occurring oil that is secreted from the scalp to provide moisture and serve as a protective mechanism," explains Sanders. "These oils are released down the hair strand, but due to the unique patterns of naturally textured hair, these oils can get trapped at the root." She explains that the scalp microbiome also consists of yeast, and if the scalp is too oily, the yeast will feed off the trapped sebum and can trigger <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>dandruff or dermatitis</a>. "It's essential to reset the scalp frequently to prevent these scalp complications," she says.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-2-detangle-curly-hair-before-washing></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>2. Detangle Curly Hair Before Washing</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Before cleansing the hair, it needs to be <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>detangled</a>. "Applying water to tangled hair will cause it to lock up," explains Sanders. You can detangle the hair just using water, but using a detangling spray will create more slip and lead to an easier process. Sears recommends trying the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Marc Anthony Strictly Curls Curl Envy Leave-in Conditioner</a>, which also prevents breakage and frizz.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you have a fine hair texture with a loose curl pattern, running your fingers throughout the hair is a gentle way to detangle without causing breakage. For coarser hair textures and tighter curl patterns, Sanders recommends using a detangling brush or wide-tooth comb.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-3-use-the-right-shampoo-for-your-hair-concerns></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>3. Use the Right Shampoo for Your Hair Concerns</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Styling products are necessary for curly hair. However, many styling products are heavy and not water-soluble, which can cause product build-up, notes Sanders. "I recommend using a clarifying shampoo for individuals who use styling products frequently," she says. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Pattern Beauty Clarifying Shampoo</a> gets her seal of approval. "If hair does not sud up upon first cleanse, it is a definite sign that you have product build-up, and additional cleaning is needed," she says. That said, on the days when you don't need a deep clean, choose a moisturizing shampoo, like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Pattern Beauty Hydration Shampoo</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-4-steam-your-hair></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>4. Steam Your Hair</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For the most defined and healthy-looking curls, moisture is everything. A hack that Sanders swears by is steaming your hair with conditioner. "The heat alters the hair's physical state," explains Sanders. The steam opens up the hair cuticle, giving more access to deeper layers of the hair strand and helps deliver the moisturizing ingredients of your conditioner to inside the hair cuticle.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-5-use-conditioner-the-right-way></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>5. Use Conditioner the Right Way</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We're all guilty of applying conditioner and leaving it in our hair for longer than suggested in hopes of getting softer, smoother hair. However, doing so may be causing more harm than good. "Note that most of the work that a conditioner will do is done within 15 minutes," says Sanders. "After that, nothing else is happening but clogged cuticles."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Additionally, not thoroughly rinsing out your conditioner can make styling more difficult. "I know we love the soft feeling of our hair the conditioner provides, but if the conditioner is not rinsed out completely, it creates a barrier, making it challenging to absorb any styling products that may follow," explains Sanders.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Essentially, use your conditioning products as directed on the packaging, which typically is on damp hair throughout the mid-lengths and ends of the hair. "You'll know the conditioner is evenly applied with the right amount of water and absorbing into the hair cuticle if the hair feels slimy with the conditioner in it," says Sanders.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-6-choose-the-right-styling-product-based-on-your-hair-type-and-texture></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>6. Choose the Right Styling Product Based on Your Hair Type and Texture</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Knowing your <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>curl type</a> can help you establish what kind of styling product works best with your specific curl pattern," says Sanders. Curly hair is a spectrum that's categorized into four numeral categories (type 1 to type 4) and three subcategories (A to C). It has to do with the shape and tightness of your curls. Type 1A hair type is pin-straight hair while <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>type 4C</a> is the tightest curl. It's also typical for one to have a combination of different curl patterns at once â€” be it <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>loose waves</a>, ringlets, or zig-zag curls.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Tighter curl patterns require hair products that are heavy, like creams or gels, to help control shrinkage and volume. Think something like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Mielle Organics Pomegranate & Honey Twisting SoufflÃ©</a>, which shapes the curls while conditioning them. Meanwhile, loose curl types benefit more from foams and mousses, like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Ouai Air Dry Foam</a> to avoid weighing down hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition, to curl type, you need to consider hair texture. Hair texture describes the circumference of an individual hair strand. "There are three types of hair textures, fine, medium, and coarse or thick," explains Sanders. "Hair texture is important to identify in order to establish what type, how much, and the adequate application method." Fine-to-medium hair textures require lightweight formulas with less product to avoid greasy hair. "Coarse and thick textures may require heavier and larger amounts of product," explains Sanders.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-7-learn-about-your-hairs-porosity></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>7. Learn About Your Hair's Porosity</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It is important to identify your <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>hair's porosity</a> when choosing a product to ensure the product can be adequately absorbed," says Sanders. Hair porosity describes the hair's ability to absorb water. There are three levels of porosity â€” low, medium, and high. "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Lower porosities</a> struggle with absorption because the flaps of the hair cuticle lay flat to the hair strand." It's best to use light products like foams and mousses to help the cuticle absorb the product.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Higher porosities struggle with retaining moisture because the flaps of the hair cuticle stay open," explains Sanders. So, while water can be absorbed, it cannot be retained. High porosity hair requires heavier products like creams and gels to lock in that moisture once it's absorbed.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-8-always-apply-styling-products-to-soaking-wet-hair></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>8. Always Apply Styling Products to Soaking Wet Hair</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When applying a styling product to textured hair, it's best to apply the product on soaking wet hair to help define the curls and also reduce frizz â€” another common curly hair woe.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With your fingers or a detangling brush, work the product evenly throughout the hair. Then scrunch or use the finger curl method to enhance the look of your curls. "Keep in mind scrunching activates and enhances curls, while finger coiling elongates them," says Sanders.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"For tighter hair texture, twisting them after brushing them out can give a pretty finish," adds Sears. If your hair gets dry throughout the process, continue to add water in sections.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-9-protect-your-curls-overnight></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>9. Protect Your Curls Overnight</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_64-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Protecting your curls while you sleep can help ensure your hard work of caring for and styling your hair doesn't go to waste in one day. "For styles that require the maintenance of volume, tie up the hair at night," says Sanders. You can try a <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>hair buff</a> or the pineapple method using a silk scarf, which Sears says is the most common method used by her clients.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_66-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Flip your hair over and very loosely tie it up high on the head (like the top of a pineapple) with a scrunchie," she says. "This is not about the firm hold, you want it loosely secured before taking a silk wrap and wrapping it around the hair. This will keep the roots from moving around as much while keeping the curls in formation."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_68-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Also, swap out your pillowcase for a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>satin or silk pillowcase</a> for extra protection. "We love silk pillowcases and bonnets because the hair glides, causing less friction and frizz," says Sears. She recommends a silk pillowcase for looser curl types or a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>silk bonnet</a> for tighter curls.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-10-dont-touch-your-hair></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_72-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>10. Don't Touch Your Hair</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_73-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keep your hands out of your hair to keep the hair frizz-free and smooth. "Our fingers attract the moisture and product from our hair and create frizz," says Sanders. If you must touch your hair, wait until it's completely dry.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57x5qgq2eTqr%2BtxY6hprBlpKR6ta3KnmScmaKaerCyjJysq6SpYrWitdE%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
