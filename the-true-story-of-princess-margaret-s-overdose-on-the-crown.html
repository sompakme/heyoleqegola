She also revealed that the adaptation seen in the final cut of The Crown was a lot shorter than what was originally filmed.</p>"I think she suffered from real depression, Margaret. I think her friends pretty much confirmed that. She had a total breakdown when her marriage went bust, and I think she took the sleeping pills. I don't think she particularly was thinking straight. We had a longer version to the scene and that was in, but a lot was cut. What she wanted was the pain to stop because she was in such a dark place. It is shocking to know that, but I think it's a real admission of vulnerability.
