In 2016 and 2017, Staley’s two years with Reich, the Eagles had the 4th-most rushing yards in the NFL and won a Super Bowl.</p><p>Staley, the Eagles’ 2nd-round pick in 1997, ranks fifth in franchise history with 4,807 rushing yards. He had three 1,000-yard seasons, tied for 2nd-most by an Eagle behind LeSean McCoy’s four. He finished his career with the Steelers and won his first Super Bowl ring in 2005.</p><p>Andy Reid, who coached Staley his last five years with the Eagles, brought him in as a coaching intern in 2010 and then gave him his first full-time coaching job in 2011, when he served as special teams quality control coach. Staley remained with the Eagles under Chip Kelly as well as Doug Pederson, moving up to assistant head coach in Pederson’s last three years here.</p><p>Staley grew up in West Columbia, S.C., which is about 90 miles south of Charlotte. Lions beat writer Justin Rodgers of the Detroit News reported that Staley wanted to be closer to home to help out his mom, who has health issues.</p><p>The Panthers haven’t had a top-10 offense since the 2015 Super Bowl season, when they were No. 1.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r67CrKeoqqSovam1y5qbnqSgnbaiesKopGimlqF8sbTIpZidnZyltaqtjJ6YoKSVqHy0wMClnLJloprCr7XToqWgZaeewal5zZ6uZqiRo8GpsdGsZJynkZi1br7EopqhZ2JrhXV9kWg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
