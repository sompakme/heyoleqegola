Sometimes, shoe enthusiasts are laughed at for their hobby because of how protective they are of their kicks. We will typically go to great lengths to keep our shoes clean and pristine and will do almost anything to cop a new and rare release. While all of these things may be true, there are very few sneakerheads out there who would pay close to half a million dollars. Well at a recent Stadium Goods x Sotheby's auction, that exact thing happened as someone paid $437,500 for a pair of <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel="nofollow noopener">Nike</a> Waffle Racing Flat's from 1972.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The shoe has also been referred to as the "Moon Shoe" thanks to the tracks it leaves when you walk in them.

It's clear that there is a lot of history here and now it will never be forgotten thanks to this historic purchase.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Hopefully, the person who bought these isn't feeling any buyers remorse.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Alexander Cole is the current Managing Editor of HotNewHipHop.
