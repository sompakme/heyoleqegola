It seems that Oliver El-Khatib & co. have something crazy in store for every single episode. That's certainly proven to be the case tonight. Though Popcaan is the official guest star of tonight's show, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>French Montana</a> made an appearance during Oliver El-Khatib's opening set, and he proceeded to drop three new exclusives in a row. First came the <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Gucci Mane</a> remix of his and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Kodak Black</a>'s "Lockjaw," and then French shared a new Maaly Raw-produced track off his upcoming album,&nbsp;<strong>MC4</strong>. After that, it was time to hear his highly anticipated collab with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Drake</a>, "No Shopping," which will also appear on&nbsp;<strong>MC4</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"No Shopping" is produced by Niagara's Murda Beatz and co-produced by the duo Cubeatz. Leading up to its premiere, the song was of particular interest because it was speculated that Drake's verse might contain shots directed at <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Joe Budden</a>, who, at the end of last month, released a scathing Drake diss track entitled "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Making a Murderer</a>." Less than a week later, he hit him with another one: "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Wake</a>." On "No Shopping," Drake doesn't address Budden by name, but right away, it's immediately obvious that the New Jersey vet is his target. He begins his verse by namechecking "Pump It Up," Budden's 2003 single that stands today as his biggest hit. "I'm not a one-hit wonder, they know all my stuff," he proceeds to rap. "You let me turn into the n*gga you almost was." How's ol' Joe feeling right now?&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">To be sure, there's a lot more to "No Shopping" than a slew of clever Drake subliminals. It's French's track, and it's one of his best in recent memory. His energy is more aggressive than usual, and he ride the beat effortlessly, snapping on every single bar. As of now,&nbsp;<strong>MC4&nbsp;</strong>is sounding mighty strong. The album drops August 19.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span><strong>Quotable Lyrics</strong></span>&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Last week, bwoy dem runnin' in the room<br>This week sold one point two<br>Yeah, it's a Boucheron baby boy<br>Yeah, and I know Taraji like I'm baby boy<br>And I fuck with Weezy and I'm Baby's boy<br>Yeah we the Army, better yet the Navy, boy</p><p>About The Author</p><p>&lt;b>Feature &amp;amp; News Contributor&lt;/b> Brooklyn via Toronto writer and music enthusiast.
