"When I was growing up my mum didn't know how to get the mats out of my hair, I feel like you have a different texture than mine," Mariah said to the Duchess.&nbsp;</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><p style=text-align:center id=eY_Lu3RLonKr data-wc=7><strong>WATCH:&nbsp;Meghan Markle promises to be 'unfiltered'</strong></p><p id=eVW6m6PNhgCB data-wc=50>"Nobody knew how to do my hair even as a little girl.

My hair is so curly and it's so thick. I just remember as a child, because my mum's black, and so my grandma Jeanette would do my hair. She'd go, 'Just hold onto the sink,' and I would grip my little hands on both sides.&nbsp;</p><p id=ezmBDw7RHarV data-wc=20>"You have no luxury of being tender-headed because she would take the brush and&nbsp;just whoosh, whoosh and tie it."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7aae4fdbd13c-meghan-markle-curly-hair-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e6myeNYvkGVL data-wc=8><strong>Meghan often styles her hair in bouncy curls</strong></p><p id=ezjMOAdtPIXq data-wc=77>Meghan also revealed she sympathised with Mariah when it came to hairdressers styling her locks using lots of products. "They didn't know how to do my hair. If it was a white hairdresser that had never dealt with textured hair, they would try to do a different thing. And my hair would be like,&nbsp; 'Ahhh, you're not doing that. And then if somebody had only dealt with ethnic hair it would become too much product," Mariah said.</p><p id=eB_OMyOxyyKA data-wc=29>Immediately relating to her story, Meghan said: "Oh, yeah. Oh, no. Like shellacked. Yeah, I know so much… so much heavy hair grease. I know.
