Photo / Reuters</p><h3 class=article__subheading--small>KEY POINTS:</h3><p>Jessica Simpson and Tony Romo are planning to get married, it has been claimed.</p><p>The <i>Dukes of Hazzard</i> star, who has been dating American football star Tony since her father Joe set them up last November, is reportedly planning to tie the knot for a second time.</p><p>A source close to the couple said: "Jessica has never been happier than she is when she's with Tony. She knows her first marriage didn't work out, but she has a really good feeling about this one, and wants to make her feelings for Tony clear."</p><p>Romo's close friend of three years, Michael Starr agrees. "I think they're going to get married," he told <i>Us Weekly</i> Magazine.</p><p>Even Romo's former fling Sophia Bush is weighing in.</p><p>"I think they could go the distance. They're perfect for each other. They're both funny and wonderful and kind. I'm rooting for them."</p><p>However, another friend of the singer - who was previously married to singer Nick Lachey - says the story is an elaborate stunt constructed by Jessica to promote her upcoming country music album.</p><p>The pal told America's <i>OK!</i> magazine: "I think it's a press stunt. She always leaks information about her faux love life when she's desperate to get her face on magazine covers!"</p><p>Meanwhile Jessica's ex Nick Lachey has wished her 'happiness' in her new relationship.</p><p>Lachey, speaking to <i>Us Weekly</i> about her romance with Tony Romo said: "I wish her nothing but happiness. If she's found that... good for her."</p><p>It was recently revealed Jessica is planning a new reality TV show documenting the release of her album.</p><p>A representative for CMT, the US TV network expected to broadcast the show, said: "We have had exploratory talks with Jessica's camp, but nothing has been confirmed or signed."</p><p>Lachey however, will not be going back to the reality genre that made he and Jessica superstars with MTV's <i>Newlyweds</i>.</p><p>"Reality TV is not on my radar," he told <i>Us.</i> "You learn lessons in life, and then you have a responsibility to yourself to learn from those lessons."</p><p>"I did a show a show around the making of my last record," Lachey said. "It was kind of a documentary that I did with MTV about making a record... that is an idea that I had and I thought it was a good one, so I can certainly see where she's coming from with that."</p><p>- BANG!
