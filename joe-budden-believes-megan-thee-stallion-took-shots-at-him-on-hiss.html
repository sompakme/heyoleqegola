That's going to ramp up soon in a big way, but it wasn't the only diss to another individual that her new single seemed to include. However, we've also seen a lot of other people in the culture connect themselves to this new song in unexpected ways. Unfortunately for these folks, some instances are a case of making mountains out of molehills; in other words, wrongly assuming that the Houston MC is speaking on them. Moreover, the latest person in the court of public opinion on this is <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Joe Budden</a>, who theorized on his podcast that she sent shots at his cohorts.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Like, I'ma give Meg a little more -– 'cause she dissed us on that s**t." Joe Budden expressed. "Listen, I've been scraping my head all morning trying to figure out who been dancing to <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>R. Kelly</a> recently. And then <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">it hit me like a bag of bricks</a>. Well, my girl told me. That was us!" "Everybody was trying to figure it out," Melyssa Ford exclaimed. "Alright, don't quote me, but I think that she's dissing us!" Budden concluded.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-megan-thee-stallion-shaded-the-joe-budden-podcast-co-hosts-theorize-watch>Megan Thee Stallion Shaded The Joe Budden Podcast, Co-Hosts Theorize: Watch</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">However, there's a little more nuance than that. We don't know specifically what this R. Kelly reference is about, and Joe Budden suggested that it was a specific shot at one of his co-hosts. Whether Megan Thee Stallion intended to shade anyone on this podcast or not, it's definitely aimed at someone in the rap or media space. Still, it could just as easily be a shot at Tory Lanez, or <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">any other of the more apparent disses on the record.</a></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, this is ironic considering the <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Slaughterhouse</a> rapper's <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">praise of Meg's previous single, "Cobra."</a> "Meg, yo! I ain’t gon’ lie to you. You absolutely went cr*zy on this," he remarked on his podcast. "A n***a hate on this, he hatin'. If you don’t like this, you hatin’."
