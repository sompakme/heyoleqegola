At first, he was only going to miss two games. However, after talking with Morant, they decided to increase the punishment. All of this has led to a lot of discourse about Morant and his future in the league. There are a lot of people who feel as though Ja is being reckless, and is ruining his career. Paul Pierce, however, feels a different way. In his tweet below, Pierce recounts his own personal experience and how you never know what a player might be going through.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-paul-pierce-speaks>Paul Pierce Speaks</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"I don’t care what y’all say about Ja I carried a gun after I was stabbed y’all don’t know what he going thru everyone got something to say until u really know what’s really going on in someone life when u black and rich u a target period," Pierce said. As Pierce explains, during his early years with the Celtics, he was attacked. This left him feeling vulnerable, and it led to him purchasing a weapon to defend himself. Although, there is a clear difference between self-defense and flashing weapons on your Instagram story.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Either way, Pierce does make a good point. There is no telling how Morant feels right now, and those around him are going to need to step in and help him. Regardless, this is a very distressing situation. You never want to see a player put themselves in a bad position like this. Hopefully, Morant is able to get it together, sooner rather than later.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Alexander Cole is the current Managing Editor of HotNewHipHop.
