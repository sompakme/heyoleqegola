Like football games these days, Swift's presence at the show seemed to eclipse the main event and reporters asked Stone about Swift's attendance at the show. Stone was in the press room after taking home her Best Actress in a Motion Picture, Musical or Comedy&nbsp;award and took a minute to rib her best friend.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“What an asshole, am I right?” Stone said. “I’ve known her for almost 20 years, so I’m very happy she was there. She was also nominated tonight, so I’m very happy she was there — but what an asshole.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For anyone wondering how the two crossed paths and formed a friendship stable enough to involve calling your pal an asshole, Stone explained that they met when Swift was still a teenager. During an appearance on&nbsp;The Graham Norton Show, Stone&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>said</a>&nbsp;that they initially met “at the Young Hollywood Awards when [Swift] was 18 in L.A. We just kept in touch ever since and became great friends.”<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Robyn BECK / AFP</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Swifties will remember that Stone showed her support for the superstar singer when she attended the Eras Tour last year. Stone spoke about the experience and also offered a little more insight into their friendship. And because even Emma Stone can't have it all, she even said that the only way she managed to snag a ticket was because of Swift herself.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“The concert was pretty amazing,” Stone&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told&nbsp;Vanity Fair</a>. “I was lucky because we’ve been friends for a really long time. I’ve known her since we were 17 and 18, so she hooked me up, which was very nice because I know those tickets are impossible to get. She’s a wonderful friend. She blows my mind. I mean, the amount of sheer stamina to do three-and-a-half hours and perform 44 songs and to maintain the extreme energy of the audience — I’ve never seen anything like it.”<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xKakmmWjqbyvsYytnJqrlZl6ta3YpaarZaOstqfAjGtna2xdnLytsMSnZKCkn5eytHmXbWlsbWlr</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
