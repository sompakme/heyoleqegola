With a cast that includes Sofia Boutella, Charlie Hunnam, Djimon Hounsou and the voice of Anthony Hopkins, the film is the first in a two-part saga, with the follow-up, titled&nbsp;The Scargiver,&nbsp;set to hit the streamer in April.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Rebel Moon&nbsp;started its life a decade ago as a pitch for a&nbsp;Star Wars&nbsp;project before getting redeveloped as its own entity, and indeed, a number of the critics reviewing the film make note of the perceived similarities to the George Lucas-created franchise. Notably, streaming projects are known for succeeding without needing the signoff of critical acclaim, suggesting a disconnect between reviews and general audience interest, particularly when it comes to subscriber sampling.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In his&nbsp;<a href=#>review for&nbsp;The Hollywood Reporter</a>, chief film critic David Rooney writes of&nbsp;Rebel Moon, “This is a derivative crazy-quilt endeavor loaded with enough plot to plug up a black hole but only the most feebly drawn characters to do the work.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Perhaps the harshest evisceration for&nbsp;Rebel Moon — currently holding a 26 percent approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes — comes from&nbsp;<a href=#>IndieWire</a>, which gives the movie a D- grade and dubs it Snyder’s worst film.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>Guardian</a>&nbsp;gives it one out of five stars and deems it “an ugly, unforgivably dull and self-serious mess.” The&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>Independent&nbsp;</a>opts for the same star rating and calls the movie “a mess of imagery, some of it attempting to shock, congregated largely around the idea of what might look good in a trailer.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">According to the&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>Los Angeles Times</a>,&nbsp;Rebel Moon&nbsp;“is too invested in table-setting to be fully enjoyed on its own, at times feeling more like a studio presentation deck than a piece of organic storytelling.” And&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>Daily Beast</a>&nbsp;noted that, as the first of two films,&nbsp;A Child of Fire&nbsp;is “all the more depressing for not even properly concluding its painfully shallow tale.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">And in a relatively positive 3/5 review, the U.K.’s&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>Total Film</a>&nbsp;noted, “Fans of Snyder’s heightened brand of stern, muscular filmmaking won’t be left wanting. And while the performances rarely extend beyond two-dimensional archetype, there’s still fun to be had with Charlie Hunnam’s insouciant turn as a wily pilot of the Han Solo school.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">A number of the unfavorable reviews acknowledge that the second film in the saga could help the project as a whole feel more satisfying, and Snyder himself has previously stated that he is planning&nbsp;<a href=#>for a longer director’s cut</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;A Child of Fire. The filmmaker is well-known for his work on existing IP, including his 2004 remake&nbsp;Dawn of the Dead, his adaptations of the graphic novels&nbsp;300&nbsp;and&nbsp;Watchmen, and his DC films like&nbsp;Justice League, which was given a four-hour director’s cut on HBO Max after a noisy fan campaign.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“The director’s cut is close to an hour of extra content, so I think it’s a legitimate extended universe version,” Snyder previously said. “You really get to see a lot. It’s just more painted-in all the way.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofLutwqRkrKapmbKzv4yrnJudnGK6sLvNZp6erKNisLbAjJ2msKZdp7K3tcSwqmZpYmiCeIKPamtpZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
