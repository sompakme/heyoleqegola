According to the publication, Mopreme thinks he went too far with this weaponization of 'Pac's voice for the sake of a rap battle. Apparently, he compared it to bringing a tank or dropping a nuclear bomb in a one-on-one battle, something that he thinks should stay a personal showdown with no external help. Mopreme also considered the context of this being rap beef (something that Tupac and other icons were no strangers to), acknowledging how the Toronto rapper just did this to get a rise out of K.Dot and his love for the "All Eyez On Me" MC.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Furthermore, Mopreme Shakur also commented on a point of retort that Drake fans have for people criticizing his use of A.I. technology here. OVO supporters called out Kendrick Lamar's "conversation" with Tupac Shakur on "Mortal Man" off of To Pimp A Butterfly, which he constructed using old interview clips and re-contextualizing them with new questions from the former <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>TDE</a> MC. However, Mopreme actually co-signed this specific homage according to TMZ Hip Hop due to its presentation as a respectful tribute that touches on the themes that 'Pac was actually passionate about in that interview. All that aside, he said that he's got love for both MCs in this head-to-head, and for <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>J. Cole</a> as well. Mopreme wants them to <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">stay focused on the sport</a>, but to avoid incendiary moments like these and prevent violence from taking over.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-drake-s-taylor-made-freestyle-diss-against-kendrick-lamar-using-a-i-tupac-amp-snoop-dogg-voices-listen>Drake's "Taylor Made Freestyle" Diss Against Kendrick Lamar Using A.I. Tupac & <a href=# class=text-word>Snoop Dogg</a> Voices: Listen</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Of course, Mopreme Shakur said that he loves hearing his brother's voice, but not in this combative and exploitative context. Still, according to TMZ Hip Hop, apparently Drake's "Taylor Made Freestyle" made him realize that this technology is "a hell of a tool." But for younger generations specifically, Mopreme fears that they won't be able to tell the difference between the real and fake 'Pac. As for who's "winning" this beef right now, he thinks they still have <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">more in store</a>, so he can't call a victor just yet.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, what do you think about that last point, and about this A.I. situation as a whole? Did you catch what Snoop Dogg <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">had to say about it</a> after Drizzy used his A.I. voice, too?
