The <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">disturbing video</a> has been making its rounds online, with many calling it the smoking gun fans needed to convince them of his guilt. In the footage, the Bad Boy Records founder is seen pulling the singer to the ground, kicking her, and trying to drag her back to his room. He also throws what appears to be a glass vase at her.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">For those who don't recall, Cassie sued Diddy in November of last year, accusing him of sexual assault, physical abuse, and more in her now-settled lawsuit. The footage certainly appears to corroborate some of her allegations, though the Los Angeles D.A.'s Office says the incident occurred <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"beyond the timeline where a crime of assault can be prosecuted."</a></p><span></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Today, Diddy broke his silence for the first time since the graphic footage surfaced online, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">issuing an apology</a> for his actions. “It’s so difficult to reflect on the darkest times in your life, but sometimes you got to do that," he said. "I was&nbsp;f*cked&nbsp;up — I hit rock bottom — but I make no excuses. My behavior on that video is inexcusable. I take full responsibility for my actions in that video. I was disgusted then when I did it. I’m disgusted now. I went and I sought out professional help, I got into going to therapy, going to rehab. I had to ask God for his mercy and grace. I’m so sorry. But I’m committed to be a better man&nbsp;each and every&nbsp;day. I’m not asking for forgiveness.&nbsp;I’m truly sorry.”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Now, social media users are reacting to the mogul's apology, with most agreeing that they don't accept it. The phrase <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"No Diddy"</a> is currently trending on Twitter/X, with countless commenters weighing in on his recent response. Many also argue that the person who really needs an apology is Cassie, though he failed to address her directly in his post.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-social-media-users-react-to-diddy-s-apology>Social Media Users React To Diddy's Apology</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What do you think of Diddy breaking his silence as the <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">2016 footage</a> of him assaulting Cassie goes viral?
