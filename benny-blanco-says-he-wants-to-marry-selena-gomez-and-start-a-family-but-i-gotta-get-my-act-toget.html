I get home from work, I think I had a good day. I’m like, ‘What did you do?’ ‘Oh, I just filmed this thing with Meryl Streep and then I went to a fundraiser and now I’m recording,’” Blanco said of how Gomez might recap her day. “My day sounds like shit every day compared to hers,” he said with a laugh.</p><p>Of <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.etonline.com/benny-blanco-talks-potential-marriage-with-selena-gomez-and-wanting-kids-225471 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>the possibility of kids</u></a>, Blanco said “That’s, like, my next goal on the box.
