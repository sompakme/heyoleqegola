One time, his computer broke, and he had to do his weather broadcast using a dry-erase board, commenting "We're gonna go John Madden on everything" as he scribbled away with black and blue markers. And then there's the time he felt his crew was "<a href=#>dragging [him] down</a>" and went off at them&nbsp;for complaining to him about the weather. "Doesn't matter what time I come on, 4:30, 5:30, 6:30," he snapped, "and then you expect me to be chipper for five straight hours!" At least co-workers can be heard giggling in the background, and one of them wisecracks afterward, "That was terrifying!"</p><p>But maybe Frank isn't so bad. When he left the network in 2019 to return to his hometown of Kansas City, radio station WFGR <a href=#>lamented the loss</a>. "While we are happy Garry is going home, we will certainly miss his shenanigans," WFGR's website said. And, WXMI's own crew&nbsp;paid tribute to Frank with a top five list of "moments": cleaning out the studio refrigerator, his friendship with a co-worker identified as Davis, wearing shorts and dancing, the number of times he sneezed on-air, and, at the top of the list, his famous rant, which also made it to Jimmy Kimmel's show. Several of the videos have since been removed from YouTube.&nbsp;</p><p>These days, Frank works for <a href=#>Fox 4</a>&nbsp;in Kansas City, but it is unknown if he is as colorful there as he was during his time in Michigan.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2Fk21tb2pfrLKiwMeeqaadnmKvrbvOqZyrq12ptaLAjLCcZpuRo8Fuv9Oop2avkamwqbXNoGY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
