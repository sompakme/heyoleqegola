Chaplin built the movie <a href=# data-unsp-sanitized=clean>"The Kid"</a> around Coogan, and the 1921 film made 5-year-old Coogan a sensation. By the time he was 21, Coogan had earned $2 million from films (and likely another $5 million from merchandise, per the <a href=# data-unsp-sanitized=clean>Associated Press</a>), but since he was a child, his mother and stepfather, lawyer Arthur Bernstein, had looked after the money, doling out only $6.25 a week to Coogan.&nbsp;</p><p>When he reached adulthood, Coogan asked for his trust. Not only was he denied, but he also discovered that only about $600,000 was left, his mother and stepfather having spent the rest of the money on themselves. The actor had little recourse but to sue his parents.</p><p>Coogan won the suit, according to the <a href=# data-unsp-sanitized=clean>Library of Congress</a>, but legal fees further ate up what little was left of his bank account, leaving the 23-year-old actor with about $126,000. However, the high profile of the suit and the egregious nature of the actions that led to it resulted in California passing the "Coogan Law," per <a href=# data-unsp-sanitized=clean>SAG-AFTRA</a>. While it contained many loopholes and would be subsequently amended over the years, the law gave financial protection to child actors, requiring their parents to place at least 15% of the minor's earnings in a trust accessible when the performer reaches adulthood.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9j3BwcnBoZMGpsYytqZqfmZh6s7HApWSloZaaerTAzquwZqeWYsKvr8ueZJ%2Bdo6mys3nFq6amZaSdsm6tw52Ypqtdm66utcuyZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
