One catchy song, a season or two of a hit TV show about werewolves or vampires, and bam—little-known figures would be catapulted to superstardom, the kind that makes you go, "Oh, them!" all these years later.</p><p>After their big break, some of those '00s stars went on to long careers; others took a break or saw their popularity wane. But in recent years, as with <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/forgotten-1990s-icons/>forgotten '90s stars</a>, a lot of the celebrities on this list experienced a resurgence as Y2K found its way back into popular culture. Frankly, I want even more for my '00s stars—put them all back on my TV screen immediately, please and thanks.</p><h2 id=bridget-fonda-3>Bridget Fonda</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zzqDnwKpox7evE8VPpP2cR-1920-80.jpg><p>Granted, a lot of Bridget Fonda's greatest hits were in the '90s (the second Godfather, Single White Female, Jackie Brown, to name a few), she worked into the early 2000s, including on films like After Amy and Kiss of the Dragon, before retiring from acting.</p><h2 id=willa-ford-3>Willa Ford</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AULh9WhxweCLcamDrgeyNK-1920-80.jpg><p>After the success of her debut album Willa Was Here in 2001, Willa Ford continued making music into the 2010s; She was also a Playboy and Maxim model as well as actor (Friday the 13th) and TV personality (Dancing With the Stars in 2006).</p><h2 id=cris-judd-3>Cris Judd</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RaWuRdQDCaRTDJqe4irmwA-1920-80.jpg><p>The former Mr. <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/jennifer-lopez/>Jennifer Lopez</a> is probably known for being just that, but the backup dancer is also a choreographer and an actor to boot (as the former, he appeared on&nbsp;Keeping Up with the Kardashians&nbsp;and The Real Housewives of New Jersey,&nbsp;apparently!).</p><h2 id=patrick-fugit-3>Patrick Fugit</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/q2rVku2GZE6KdkvKUkLkM5-1920-80.jpg><p>Patrick Fugit's most notable works both were released in the '00s (that would be Almost Famous&nbsp;in 2000 and Saved!&nbsp;in 2004). But, if you're wondering to yourself, Wait, I thought I saw him recently! he's had more recent supporting roles in Gone Girl, Love & Death, and Babylon. We love a resurgence!</p><h2 id=ruben-studdard-3>Ruben Studdard</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5UatgrtTxcQtV2qVhK6kJY-1920-80.jpg><p>The winner of the second season of American Idol, Ruben Studdard has released several studio albums. He's also worked as an actor and reality star, including on a season of The Biggest Loser. Also, I just really enjoy this: In 2018, he costarred in Ruben & Clay’s First Annual Christmas Carol Family Fun Pageant Spectacular Reunion Show. Lol!!</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

In case you missed it, the singer and actor (who's also an entrepreneur, no biggie) also has starred in some incredibly named recent Netflix romcoms: Resort to Love and Falling Inn Love (oh my god!!).</p><h2 id=vitamin-c-3>Vitamin C</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2Sz9DAp8LPRoabjbDqTWUN-1920-80.jpg><p>"As our lives change, come whatever / We will still be friends foreverrrrrrr!" Don't pretend you don't know the words of Graduation (Friends Forever), Vitamin C's most popular hit. Technically that song was released in 1999, but it took over our lives in the '00s. Fun fact: Vitamin C is a music exec as of 2012!</p><h2 id=macy-gray-3>Macy Gray</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/77SbFKLVKSWXryD4gsHc93-1920-80.jpg><p>This list is just going to be full of songs with catchy tunes, to be honest. Technically, Macy Gray's "I Try" was released in 1999, but it was incredibly popular for years. Gray continued to make music; She was featured on <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/ariana-grande/>Ariana Grande</a>'s "Leave Me Lonely" and was also on The Masked Singer.</p><h2 id=ashlee-simpson-3>Ashlee Simpson</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L8k2tMJhpFBmeYeCQpqRAB-1920-80.jpg><p>Ashlee Simpson's song "Pieces of Me" was released in 2004 (we're all old!), which was a big decade for the singer. She also starred in The Ashlee Simpson Show and 7th Heaven before playing the lead in the musical Chicago. Simpson married singer Evan Ross in 2014 and goes by Ashlee Simpson Ross—and they've worked together!</p><h2 id=michelle-trachtenberg-3>Michelle Trachtenberg</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DnqZZkfdMRVdvwGHR3FZsW-1920-80.jpg><p>The erstwhile Harriet the Spy in the '90s is probably either known to you as her role as Buffy's sister in Buffy the Vampire Slayer or as socialite Georgina in Gossip Girl. That latter role she reprised in the rebooted show, and she's continued to work regularly.</p><h2 id=jonathan-bennett-3>Jonathan Bennett</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/szDQXydjZfz8qunh25oZum-1920-80.jpg><p>Aaron Samuels from Mean Girls has really embraced the fact that everyone thought he was a hunk when that movie came out. (Speaking of coming out, he's happily out of the closet and starred in the first LGBTQ+ Hallmark movie!) He's continued to work, including on Broadway with Spamalot. FYI, his <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.instagram.com/jonathandbennett/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>social media</a> is an absolute treat and worth the follow.</p><h2 id=eve-3>Eve</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PdSGNVfyuzkT7BUsWsXhGh-1920-80.jpg><p>Eve's debut album was released in 1999, but the 2000s were huge for her (she went double platinum!!). She has acted in small roles, but your most recent glimpse of the rapper and singer was probably on The Talk on CBS, which she co-hosted until 2020. She's also continued to work as a musical artist.</p><h2 id=julia-stiles-3>Julia Stiles</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yaW6Db24dwpmkkdg7w3Jgf-1920-80.jpg><p>Julia Stiles' adorable eyeroll was the best part of 10 Things I Hate About You,&nbsp;Down to You, and&nbsp;Save the Last Dance. After her initial teen stardom, Stiles went on to have a recurring role in the Bourne movies and did TV work with Dexter. If you want some campy horror fun, check her out in Orphan: First Kill.</p><h2 id=dido-3>Dido</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YUGLoZCpuZGosNFTFjaTCf-1920-80.jpg><p>I really, really can't think about Dido's music at all, lest I have her music stuck in my head for days. (Too late, it's already happening!). If you're wondering, she released her fifth studio album in 2019 (Still on My Mind), she's collaborated with brother Rollo, and re-recorded her vocals for&nbsp;Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike's "Thank You (Not So Bad)" in 2023.</p><h2 id=justin-guarini-3>Justin Guarini</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tyEKE96dzgeXFdVn6bS6e-1920-80.jpg><p>Runner-up to Kelly Clarkson on American Idol, Justin Guarini has released several albums.
