Despite his televised success, Grammer's personal life was plagued by tragedy.&nbsp;</p><p>In 1968, when Grammer was 13 years old, his estranged father was fatally shot by a cab driver. As the Emmy-winner explained during his 2001 E! Celebrity Profile&nbsp;(via the&nbsp;<a href=#>New York Post</a>),&nbsp;"A man who was proven to be, at least in court, of questionable sanity, I suppose, lit a ring of fire around his house and as my father came down to investigate what was going on, he shot him...several times and, uh, dad died."&nbsp;</p><p>In 1975, violence struck again when Grammer's 18-year-old sister, Karen, was abducted, raped, and fatally stabbed <a href=#>42 times</a> by "spree killer" Freddie Glenn and two accomplices, according to <a href=#>Vanity Fair</a>.&nbsp;The actor identified her body.&nbsp;In 2009, Glenn was up for parole—which Grammer successfully opposed.&nbsp;"I miss her in my bones," he wrote to the parole board (via <a href=#>Vanity Fair</a>). "I was her big brother. I was supposed to protect her—I could not... It very nearly destroyed me."</p><p>In 1980, Grammer's half brothers, Stephen and Billy, died in a scuba accident off St. Thomas. According to <a href=#>People</a>, when Billy failed to surface, Stephen dove in to try to find him but "suffered a fatal embolism during an improper ascent. Billy's body was never recovered." His mother believes "he was eaten by sharks."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcWphaYJwsMCromarlZi%2FpsDSZpqaq6Ris7Ot0qKcq2Wkp7amsIyhoJ2dXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
