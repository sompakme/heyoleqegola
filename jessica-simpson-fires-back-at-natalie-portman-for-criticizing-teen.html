While promoting her new music drama <a href=# rel=noopener>Vox Lux</a>, Portman — who plays a Madonna-inspired pop star in the film — shared her thoughts on the virgin/vixen paradigm that was archetypal of young female artists at the turn of the new millennium.</p><p>“I remember being a teenager, and there was Jessica Simpson on the cover of a magazine saying, ‘I’m a virgin’ while wearing a bikini,” she said of the singer, who famously made a pact with her preacher dad, Joe Simpson, to save herself for marriage with now-ex-husband Nick Lachey.</p><p>Portman added, “And I was confused. Like, I don’t know what this is trying to tell me as a woman, as a girl.”</p><p>Portman later responded to Simpson in an Instagram comment. “@jessicasimpson Thank you for your words. I completely agree with you that a woman should be allowed to dress however she likes and not be judged,” she wrote. “I only meant to say I was confused — as a girl coming of age in the public eye around the same time — by the media’s mixed messages about how girls and women were supposed to behave.”</p><p>Added Portman: “I didn’t mean to shame you and I’m sorry for any hurt my words may have caused. I have nothing but respect for your talent and your voice that you use to encourage and empower women all over the globe.”</p><p>See Jessica Simpson’s post below.</p><p dir=ltr lang=und><a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/zBLuyF3a8p</a></p><p>— Jessica Simpson (@JessicaSimpson) <a href=# rel=nofollow>December 5, 2018</a></p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p><strong>Dec. 5, 12:32 p.m.</strong> Updated with Portman’s Instagram response.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnl5q7pr7ApWSnnaeofKux0qygnJldqLauvNKopWaemaeytHnBmpqkZZGpeq%2Bt05qjop1dpbyzwMyapWabop7Bqq%2FIs6Cnn12psqa6jJugpKGennq0tM6oq2ZpYWuDd4SSaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
