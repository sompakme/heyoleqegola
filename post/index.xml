There’s a heartfelt impetus behind Amma Asante’s new film, a period drama set in Nazi Germany with an interracial theme at its heart. The film gives us elements of melodrama and also of epic – yet there is also something a little uncomfortable about it.
Asante’s original screenplay is inspired by the historical case of what were crudely called Rheinlandbastarde, mixed-race people in Nazi Germany who had been fathered by military personnel of African background in the Occupied Rhineland after the first world war.</description></item><item><title>Which dog is most beautiful eyes?</title><link>/which-dog-is-most-beautiful-eyes.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/which-dog-is-most-beautiful-eyes.html</guid><description>Out of all these blue-eyed dogs, the Siberian Husky is arguably the one most associated with lighter eye color.

A lonely man
Who lost his love
Through his indifferenceA heart that cared
That went unshared
Until it died
Within his silence
And solitare's the only game in town
And every road that takes him
Takes him down
And by himself it's easy to pretend
He'll never love again
And keeping to himself he plays the game
Without her love

Hear the melody that's playing.

There's so much to celebrate.
Believe in what you feel inside,</description></item><item><title> Fans remember James King as memorable My 600-lb Life episode re-airs Thu 16 June 2022 11:10</title><link>/fans-remember-james-king-as-memorable-my-600-lb-life-episode-re-airs-thu-16-june-2022-11-10.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/fans-remember-james-king-as-memorable-my-600-lb-life-episode-re-airs-thu-16-june-2022-11-10.html</guid><description>James King appeared on My 600-lb Life in 2017 before he sadly passed away in 2020.
