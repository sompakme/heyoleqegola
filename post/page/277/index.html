Charles Ray Knight (born December 28, 1952) is a former right-handed Major League Baseball corner infielder who played for the Cincinnati Reds and the New York Mets. Knight was drafted in the tenth round of the 1970 Major League Baseball Draft by the Cincinnati Reds. Reds fans will remember him as the man who replaced Pete Rose at third base, while Mets fans will remember him as the man who scored the game-winning run in game six of the 1986 World Series and was named the series MVP. <a href=../../../ray-knight-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>Read More...</a></section></article><article class=list-item itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Blog><h2 class=headline itemprop=headline><a href=../../../the-tragic-truth-about-willie-nelson.html>The Tragic Truth About Willie Nelson</a></h2><div class=meta><span class=key>published on</span>
