Because the forces from contact with the pillow that cause the skin to be stretched, pushed and pulled are mechanical, muscle immobilizers such as Botox, which work on expression wrinkles, are ineffective for sleep wrinkles. "Sleep wrinkles disappear immediately on younger skin, but will eventually become permanent from constant compression and decreased skin elasticity with age," says Dr. Anson.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The key to preventing them is sleeping on your back, which also has other beauty benefits, like clearer, firmer skin and better back alignment. "They can be treated with wrinkle creams and fillers such as Juvederm and Restylane, but they will likely come back or develop in adjacent areas if you don't address the real problem, which is facial compression." Dr. Anson recommends minimizing your facial contact with the bedding as much as possible, but realizes that changing your unconscious sleeping habits can be difficult: "A supportive anti-wrinkle pillow that prevents facial contact should be part of your preventative and anti-aging skin care routine, but it should be noted that some people with certain medical issues such as sleep apnea, gastric reflux, neck and back problems and pregnant women should not sleep on their backs." As for copper-threaded and satin pillowcases, there is "some research in favor of copper material and theoretically silk or satin will create less traction, however, any pillowcase fabric will still result in contact and compression of the face. The best option is to have a consistent anti-aging skin care routine, and learn how to avoid sleeping on your face."</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/fae6c85d-bef8-475b-bd8c-518bcb0d820c.jpg alt="Headshot of Alexandra Tunell" title="Headshot of Alexandra Tunell" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Alexandra Tunell is the Senior Digital Beauty Editor at Harper's BAZAAR, where she writes beauty features and covers industry news, health, fitness and wellness trends.
