She is right on one thing: Football, like any other sport, is dangerous from many angles, but one has to keep in mind that professional Football and kids playing Football are two different things.</p><p>Professional athletes know what they are doing- they intentionally put their bodies in line and are rewarded for their entertaining acts. On the other hand, kids who play Football need to be supervised, and not all will go on to play full-time.</p><h2>What will America look like without Football?</h2><p>For once, let us imagine that Football is dangerous and gets cancelled. Approximately 70% of the athletes involved in the game are black men. Moreover, these men not only entertain huge crowds but also return their earnings to their communities. Damar Hamlin is also one of those players; even while injured, he has raised enough money- $7.7 million- through his toy drive. This toy drive will put a smile on many kids’ faces- which could not be done without Football.</p><p>So, without Football, a lot of Americans would inevitably suffer. This magnificent game helps plenty of people, not just in America but around the globe- to work in teams, learn to discipline themselves, and overall live a better life.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Joy Behar suffers dramatic fall on ‘The View,’ face-plants in front of audience <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/wO4YkzOp8Y</a></p><p>— Flint Bedrock (@flintbedrock) <a href=# rel=noopener>March 3, 2022</a></p><p>Then again, we leave you with the question- Do you agree with Joy Behar and want Football to be cancelled?
