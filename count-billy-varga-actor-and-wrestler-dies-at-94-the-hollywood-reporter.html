Both went by the denomination of count, bestowed upon them as members of Hungarian nobility.</p><p>Born in Cleveland, Varga wrestled in more than 500 matches from the 1930s to the ’70s and was known for his speed inside the ropes. He went to Hollywood High School and lived in the Los Angeles area for more than 70 years.&nbsp;</p><p>Varga often played a wrestler, boxing announcer or referee onscreen, with roles in such films as Bodyhold (1949); Miss Sadie Thompson (1953) with <strong>Rita Hayworth;</strong> Abbott & Costello Meet the Keystone Kops (1955); <strong>Stanley Kramer</strong>‘s Oklahoma Crude (1973), starring <strong>George C. Scott</strong> and <strong>Faye Dunaway</strong>; and <strong>Martin </strong><strong>Scorsese</strong>‘s&nbsp;Raging Bull (1980).</p><p>Varga also appeared on such TV shows as The Jack Benny Program, Burke’s Law,&nbsp;The Munsters (as Strangler Murphy, he memorably wrestled&nbsp;<strong>Fred </strong><strong>Gwynne</strong>‘s Herman, who was out to make some extra money for son Eddie’s education), Matlock and The Fall Guy. He and his late son, <strong>Billy Varga Jr.</strong>, appeared in National Geographic’s The Mohave Desert (1971).</p><p>Varga, who served in the Navy during World War II, stayed in touch with his fellow wrestlers as a member of the Cauliflower Alley Club.&nbsp;</p><p>Survivors include grandchildren Billy the III, Lisa, Eain, Tania and Joseph. A memorial service is set for 11 a.m. Saturday at <a href=# rel=nofollow>Holy Cross Cemetery</a> in Culver City.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofKS71KerZpqZobm6edWaqaCZXay%2Fpr%2FTpZyrZZ2qu7TAxKuqZmxhaINygo4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
