However, some were divided on their thoughts about one repair completed by Brenton West. Gordon and his daughter Kelly came into the barn with Gordon's medal he received in his army days when he served in the Middle East and Germany. <a href=../../../../the-repair-shop-fans-divided-over-error-with-repair-in-new-episode.html>Read More...</a></section></article><article class=list-item itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Blog><h2 class=headline itemprop=headline><a href=../../../../who-is-stronger-darkseid-or-trigon.html>Who is stronger Darkseid or Trigon?</a></h2><div class=meta><span class=key>published on</span>

Some of the actors on the show claimed there would be a high body count this season, and they weren't lying. We're halfway through the season and things just keep getting bloodier. This week, Proctor seals his own fate after getting a little too bold with his power moves. It all begins with Saxe. The snarky prosecutor's sloppy plans keep getting people killed. <a href=../../../../power-ep-5-tariq-s-life-is-on-the-line.html>Read More...</a></section></article></main><nav class=paginator><a class=nav-left href=../../../../categories/blog/page/381/index.html>&lt; Prev</a>
