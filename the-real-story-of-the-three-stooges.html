The three men finally left Healy's employ and signed a contract with Columbia Pictures. From 1934-1946 they produced and starred in nearly 200 short comedy films, characterized by verbal and physical abuse (for comic effect, of course), slapstick, and farce.</p><p>Curly, the baby of the family (and referred to by family members as "Babe"), suffered a vicious stroke in 1946 and, with the exception of a couple of brief film appearances, for all intents and purposes was out of the act. Shemp rejoined the group until 1955, when he died of a heart attack. Joe Palma took Shemp's place briefly so the group could finish its contract with Columbia. Joe Besser worked with Moe and Larry as the third Stooge for two years, replaced by Joe DeRita, "Curly Joe," for a series of <a href=#>theatrical films</a> beginning in 1958.</p><p>Like many early film acts, the Stooge short films were cut (often badly) for use on television and sold off by the studio in the late 1950s. Unlike many acts, however, the Stooges received residual payments for their work. Not exactly knuckleheads, no matter what Moe might have told you. With their exposure via the new medium, the Stooges found themselves riding a new wave of popularity. In 1970 they were filming a new television pilot when Larry Fine was felled by a stroke, the first of several.</p><p>Fine died in January 1975; Moe followed in May of that year, after suffering from lung cancer. Besser died in 1988, DeRita in 1993, and Palma in 1994 — the last of the Six Stooges.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9l3JtanBfqbWmedGemKVlo6m8s8WMqJ1mrJiaerW00Z6cZqukpLyosdJo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
