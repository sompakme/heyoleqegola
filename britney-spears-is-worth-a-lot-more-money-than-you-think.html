According to <a href=#>Yahoo</a>, the divorcees shared custody of their two children, Sean Preston and Jayden James, at the start of their divorce, but that dropped to a 70/30 split in Federline's favor in 2019. Yahoo reported that, after their divorce, Federline received a $1.3 million settlement from Spears. However their child support has been a contentious battle at best.</p><p>In 2018, Federline filed for more child support from Spears beyond the $20,000 he received each month until then, according to <a href=#>People</a>. "We think the reasonable needs for the children while they would be in Kevin's custody is probably three times what he's currently receiving," Mark Vincent Kaplan, Federline's attorney, told the magazine. That means Federline is asking for $60,000 a month instead of $20,000. At the time, a source close to Spears told <a href=#>ET</a> that the singer already covers most of their sons' expenses on top of the child support she pays. "We want to know where that $20,000 is going," the source told the outlet. "Kevin wants a raise in money and he can't account for where the $20,000 is going."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbGxmaYF2e8GroK2mla56tLzEmqmsZZmoeri70a2fZpldoby1ecyoqZ5lnaS7psWMrZ%2Bapl2uvLZ506Ggp6Nf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
