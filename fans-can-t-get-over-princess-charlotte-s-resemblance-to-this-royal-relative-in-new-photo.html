I never used to get too wound up or worried about things. But now the smallest little things, you well up a little more, you get affected by the sort of things that happen around the world or whatever a lot more, I think, as a father."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3b76dc8334f5-prince-william-george-charlotte-louis-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eKjvnQOR4qjQ data-wc=9><strong>Royal fans think Princess Charlotte looks like Princess Diana&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=e7SOc_yWd6ch data-wc=39>"Just because you realize how precious life is and it puts it all in perspective.

Honestly, you get to the end of the day and you write down the list of all the things that you've done in that day. So you pitch a tent, take the tent down again, cook, bake. You get to the end of the day - they have had a lovely time - but it is amazing how much you can cram into one day that's for sure."</p><p id=emnkrDpBv5qM data-wc=23></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
