She's been wearing makeup forever, that is a self-expression for her," she explained.&nbsp;</p><p id=eVa6O9MwsB data-wc=27>"She loves to dress up.

Her dad comes from a big family of actors, including Rosanna and Patricia Arquette.&nbsp;</p><p id=eE3jl2MEPw41 data-wc=29>"She loves musical theater," the actress explained, adding: "She's a really good singer. She's done plays since she was, you know, in kindergarten. Probably like 33 musical theater plays."&nbsp;</p><p id=eCvJMpSOSQ data-wc=28>"So, she's going into the family business," host Kelly Ripa teased – but Courteney quickly clarified: "I don't sing… let's not go too far in the family part."&nbsp;</p><p id=eWhMcCwB7f data-wc=23>She added: "[She has] a very good sense of humor.
