style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>A controversial restaurant chain has collapsed just two years after launching in Australia after being mired in controversy.</p><p>On Monday, a notice was released on ASIC that Viral Ventures (Australia) Pty Ltd had gone into voluntary liquidation.</p><p>The appointed liquidators are Chris Johnson and Andrew McCabe of insolvency firm Wexted Advisors.</p><p>Viral Ventures (Australia) Pty Ltd trades restaurants under the name Karen’s Diner and Broadway Diner.</p><p>The restaurants were infamous for their themed dining experiences for patrons.</p><p>Karen’s Diner was centred around the gimmick of the staff acting rudely towards customers as ‘Karens’, but courted controversy by offending restaurant-goers, and in some cases had to issue apologies.</p><p>Meanwhile, Broadway Diner was themed to that of a 1950s musical, with staff performing musical numbers for seated guests.</p><p>Karen’s Diner first launched in Australia through its Sydney city store in October 2021 and since then several more stores opened — another in Sydney, and one in Adelaide and Brisbane.<br></p><p>They also launched three pop-up Karen’s Diner restaurants in Melbourne, the Gold Coast and Perth.</p><p>The company announced last week that all three of these pop-ups had been shut down.</p><p>“Unfortunately, all good things come to an end and Karen can’t stay forever!” the post read.</p><p>“Today marks the closing of some of our Australian pop-up stores.</p><p>“If your local pop-up store has closed, there will be a Karen’s Diner On Tour coming to your city this September.”</p><p>This tour turned out to not be the case, because just days later, the company entered liquidation.</p><p>News.com.au contacted the liquidators.</p><p>The parent company of Viral Ventures Australia, Viral Venture Global, said all Sydney stores of Karen’s Diner remained open.</p><p>“As a result of the liquidation, pop ups in Perth, Gold Coast and Melbourne ceased trading,” a spokesperson said.</p><p>“Unfortunately rising costs of goods, interest rates, utility increases and a reduction of consumer spending impacted the business heavily.”</p><p>They said all the stores that had been shut were pop-ups, and that the permanent stores were still in business.</p><p>“Our other stores domestically and internationally are not affected,” the spokesperson added.</p><p>The chain also has stores in Indonesia, Singapore, New Zealand, the UK, Canada, and the US.<br></p><p>The company is no stranger to controversy.</p><p>Karen’s Diner was forced to apologise in the past after staff took their rudeness act a little too far.</p><p>In July, an employee at the Brisbane store made sexually inappropriate comments to a 14-year-old girl and her father, <a class=body-link href=# data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=bc2d921aa5887d360e6554e52e3a0854 data-tgev-label=travel data-tgev-metric=ev>saying the girl was on Only Fans and her dad was a paedophile</a>.</p><p>The store was also called out for <a class=body-link href=# data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=379d836252841a37a8f1053a6a17d79e data-tgev-label=lifestyle data-tgev-metric=ev>body shaming a bald man in Brisbane</a>, slamming the joke as “cruel”.</p><p>And in November, the ABC reported staff were considering formal action over claims of sexual and physical harassment.</p><p>The hospitality scene across Australia has been gutted in a post-pandemic world as the cost of living crisis rages, causing many cafes and restaurants to go bust.</p><p>On Thursday, news.com.au reported that a former franchisee of Sydney food chain Flipp Burgers had gone into liquidation.</p><p>Just a week earlier, a Sydney restaurant called Little Viet Kitchen and two Hog’s Breath cafes in NSW also went bust.</p><p>Last month, national restaurant chain Sushi Bay also collapsed, with its last remaining Sydney, Darwin and Canberra branches ordered to shut down, amid allegations that workers had been underpaid $650,000 over a number of years.</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>In March, a popular bar and burger joint in Melbourne’s inner city, The Beer & Burger Bar, went into voluntary liquidation owing around $500,000 to 10 unsecured creditors.</p><p>Also in March, Sydney’s Jellyfish Cafe, in the northern beaches, which specialised in seafood dishes and brunch favourites, went into liquidation after nearly two decades of operation.</p><p><i>— With NCA Newswire</i></p><p class=postsid
