Yes, it should shield your face from the sun, but the wrong style can look silly — which is something I learned the hard way. Desperate to keep my face from frying in the Italian summer sun a few years back, I picked up a five Euro fedora from an Amalfi Coast street vendor. When I got home, I realized that not only did I look ridiculous in every photo, but I still got sunburnt. So, take it from me: buy a stylish, non-mortifying sun hat prior to jetting off on your next vacation.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You might be thinking, But I don't have any room in my carry-on for a floppy sun hat. So, allow me to introduce you to packable sun hats. As the name suggests, they offer the same protection as regular sun hats, but they fold into themselves for easy packing. The magic really happens when you arrive at your destination: The hat pops right back into its original form without any structural damage.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There are plenty of flattering designs available, from resort-worthy straw hats to on-trend visors and everything in between. But with so many options, it's hard to know where to begin. To help you out, I searched high and low for the best packable sun hats and chatted with stylists and fellow editors to compile a list of hats that you'll actually want to wear.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-madewell-packable-braided-straw-hat></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Madewell Packable Braided Straw Hat</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Madewell Packable Braided Straw Hat" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/3skZceRuIzjjmo6d4iz536hdMfc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/madewell-packable-braided-straw-hat-7da4fd4a08614aa9b49b4bdf5a361949.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list"><li><p>It sells out fast.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Maybe I'm a little too into the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>'coastal grandmother' aesthetic</a>, but in my opinion, a trusty sun hat is an essential part of every beach trip. This one from Madewell has just the right amount of everything: Structure, sun protection, and style. Thanks to its 95 percent paper straw composition, the hat has just enough stiffness so that the sides stay upright, while still having a considerable amount of flop. The brim offers three and a half inches of protection — aka enough to cover your face — but you're still able to see what's ahead of you. It comes with a multipurpose elastic ribbon that, aside from adding a subtle stylish detail to the hat, ties around the hat and keeps it secure when it's folded in your bag. Beauty expert and content creator Kristina Rodulfo wore a similar version on a 10-week trip through Europe, and says, "I absolutely love how the hat covers my face but is made from a lightweight material that doesn't trap heat," she says. "I always pack a straw sun hat with a wide brim for added protection from UV rays and it looks at home on the beach or matches with a sundress."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Paper straw, elastic | <strong>Size: </strong>S/M, M/L | <strong>Colors:</strong> 4</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-value-lands-end-womens-packable-visor></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Value</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Lands' End Packable Visor</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=2940 data-sizes=750px alt="Lands' End Women's Packable Visor" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/BAxCsNH-6MQHaOnfve7kxW9Am3s=/fit-in/1500x2940/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/497109_LEPP_LF_W5N-961700e5bb5445f0a41fa0ee6d81de9b.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Lands' End</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Lover of long walks on the beach? Spend hours tending to a garden? The visor, a total classic, checks all of those boxes. As Rodulfo tells InStyle, "Visors are great for when it's so hot you need to wear your hair up but still want shade over your face." For under $20, you can snag this elegant-looking, incredibly comfortable sun hat that shields your face from the sun without making an updo feel complicated. The paper and polyester straw blend are smooth to the touch (instead of scratchy or itchy like other straw hats), and, thanks to a hidden band sewn into the interior of the hat, it stays where it's supposed to and doesn't contribute to hat hair. When you're ready to pack it up, simply roll it into a cone shape, then tie it in place.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Paper, polyester straw blend | <strong>Size: </strong>One size | <strong>Colors:</strong> 2</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-janessa-leone-hamilton-hat></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Janessa Leone Hamilton Hat</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=640 data-sizes=750px alt="Janessa Leone Hamilton Hat" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/UHfQ0N5IC0sefeG9DUHcmTZnuOc=/fit-in/1500x640/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ScreenShot2022-07-19at6.12.21PM-07a507406e02495baf4b2b7d0ff38e71.png"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Revolve</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you're going to splurge on a packable hat, let it be this one. Chloe Anello, Senior Commerce Editor at InStyle, recommends this hat, which was gifted to her, for hot summer days because she describes it as "very lightweight, which is great for days when hats are necessary but can easily make your head sweaty," she says. "I shoved it in a bag to take to the pool on two separate occasions, and each time I went to grab it from my overpacked tote, it unfolded as if I never touched it." She notes it takes a little more finagling to get it back to its original shape than others, but for how nice it looks, it's easy to look past. It also offers a UPF rating (like SPF but for textiles) of 45+ to really protect your face from the sun. It comes in four different sizes, each with the same folding capabilities for a proper fit, but you can only purchase it in two neutral shades. However, the brand offers a plethora of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">other styles</a> in case you would like to shop around.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Straw | <strong>Size: </strong>S, M, L, XL<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors:</strong> 2</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-straw-san-diego-hat-company-arizona-packable-wide-brim-hat></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Straw</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>San Diego Hat Company Arizona Packable Wide Brim Hat</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1198 data-sizes=750px alt="San Diego Hat Company Arizona Packable Wide Brim Hat" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/3YLelaMBHBOUgP7tIn-sAevnlFo=/fit-in/1500x1198/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Screenshot2023-03-23at1.22.36PM-a2ef2013bcf14715b326c14ddf88d784.png"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Free People</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>bohemian aesthetic</a> has come back around once again. Outside of just wearing <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>flare jeans</a> and jackets in dark earthy tones, the accessories truly can make or break this style. We love to add a large tote bag or chunky shoe, but the easiest of them all might just be a large, floppy hat, especially for warmer weather. We personally love this Arizona Packable Wide Brim Hat because the 100 percent paper straw material allows it to bend easily for packing. It folds up into a small bunch that can easily be thrown into your suitcase. And for warmer days, the terrycloth sweatband on the inside of the hat will absorb any wetness, ensuring your hat will&nbsp;remain fresh.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Anello tried out this hat but notes after you take it out from being folded, you’ll need to readjust the decorative band on the outside of the hat, which easily slides around. However, the band is connected to the strap that goes underneath your chin, so you won’t have to worry about it shifting around once you’re wearing it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Paper straw | <strong>Size:</strong> OS | <strong>Colors:</strong> 5</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-visor-hat-attack-roll-up-travel-visor></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Visor</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Hat Attack Roll Up Visor</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=742 data-sizes=750px alt="Hat Attack Roll Up Travel Visor" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/f7d8_xMHr84BuWOvqfrWX0aTAuY=/fit-in/1500x742/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ScreenShot2022-07-19at6.19.19PM-38c53e6f85f74e0bbac7f47ea7253a3e.png"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Revolve</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you're looking for a packable sun hat that protects you both during action and leisure, you can't go wrong with Hat Attack's Roll Up Visor. I recently wore this hat (which I was kindly gifted by the brand) during an afternoon filled with sports and lounging around. Made with 100 percent raffia straw, it has more structure than the Lands' End visor but was still surprisingly lightweight. The texture feels a bit rough to the touch, but thanks to the attached sweatband (aka the area that hugs your forehead), it never scratched my skin, keeping me comfortable the entire time. The brim extends out almost five inches, covering my whole face while laying by the pool yet still allowing me to comfortably read my book without needing to contort my neck in an awkward way.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Raffia | <strong>Size: </strong>One size | <strong>Colors:</strong> 1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-fedora-cuyana-folding-panama-hat></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Fedora</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Cuyana Folding Panama Hat</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1600 data-sizes=750px alt="Cuyana Folding Panama Hat" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/tlSGCW_YZ1lgIXPHxYtuMVeWg18=/fit-in/1500x1600/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/cuyana-hat-943056541029477e936283516ed8621f.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Cuyana</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Most of the hats on this list look particularly floppy and large. For anyone interested in a small, structured brim that’s more along the lines of a fedora, we love this handmade hat from Cuyana. By partnering with artisans in Ecuador, Cuyana offers us a well-made straw hat made from a softer weave that lends itself better to being compressed and flattened for travel without permanently altering the shape of the hat. Even though it comes in four different hat sizes, the interior band can still be adjusted for a more customized fit with velcro hidden underneath the lining (to ensure the velcro doesn’t irritate your skin). The classic straw color goes with just about anything, but we only wish it came in more color options — or fabric trim choices — to add to our collection.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Straw | <strong>Size: </strong>56–59 centimeters | <strong>Colors:</strong> 1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-wide-brim-san-diego-hat-company-womens-4-inch-brim-ultrabriad-sun-hat></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Wide Brim</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>San Diego Hat Company Women's 4-Inch Brim Ultrabriad Sun Hat</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=898 data-sizes=750px alt="San Diego Hat Company Women's 4-Inch Brim Ultrabriad Sun Hat" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/tE7QwqkT--q_NoTdEm4wYZTSq2A=/fit-in/1500x898/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/SDHC-wide-brim-f244e03233c346f3b77e91dd4cacb0e6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>San Diego Hat Company</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For those uninterested in big, floppy hats, this sun hat from San Diego Hat Company has got you covered (literally). The hat, which is woven from paper and polyester, has a structure with a hint of bohemian flair synonymous with a bigger-brimmed hat. After trying the hat (which the brand gifted to me), I immediately appreciated the sewn-in band that absorbs sweat and ensures a more comfy fit. Although the hat comes in three sizes — small, medium, and large — the brim might be too large for smaller face shapes. Nonetheless, it packs down to a small size, unfolds easily, and feels as light as smaller hats, which is pretty impressive.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Paper, polyester | <strong>Size: </strong>3 | <strong>Colors: </strong>7</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-boating-baggu-packable-sun-hat></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Boating</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Baggu Packable Sun Hat</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Baggu Packable Sun Hat" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/1x-hI4b3X8JhMf5aaMbeRK56BAA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/baggu-packable-sun-hat-4510f12129984636a4cc4dafc8d31328.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Baggu</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list"><li><p>It's a bit stiff.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Out on the open water with no shade? No problem. This packable sun hat from Baggu packs into itself and then bursts open like a tent when you need it. And the adjustable headband and chin straps secure the hat to your head, making it ideal for windy situations. Although it only comes in one size, it can be altered to fit most head shapes, up to 23.5 inches (about 1 inch larger than the average adult head). The 100 percent cotton hat packs into its own circular pouch for easy carrying and storage, no matter how much room you have in your bag. The machine washable fabric comes in nine patterns, ranging from a mod floral to trippy checkers, so you can pick one that best suits your aesthetic. We noticed that it looks a bit stiff on our heads, though — unlike straw hats, this one has a wire around the brim, which keeps it in place. It made for uniform protection around our heads when we tried it on, which we appreciated, but we would love to see a little more flexibility.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Cotton | <strong>Size: </strong>One size | <strong>Colors: </strong>16</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-hiking-wallaroo-hat-company-victoria-sun-hat></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Hiking</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Wallaroo Hat Company Victoria Sun Hat</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Wallaroo Hat Company Victoria Sun Hat" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/8LyJgkEb-IXY-aNdg2BKqS4-YaI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/wallaroo-victoria-sun-hat-21cfa8607aae4fc18f18f32a2f20bb97.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Designed to join you on all of your outdoor adventures, this hat (and its three-and-a-half-inch wide brim) from Wallaroo works to protect your face, neck, and ears from the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays. Because it's made of a poly-straw weave material that's ultra-lightweight, comfortable, and breathable, we can ensure you won't overheat while on the trail. "It blew my mind how lightweight it is," Anello shares. "Because of the hat's hidden drawstring closure, you get a custom fit and never have to worry about your hat flying away." The best part is that the hat folds up into a tiny ball that can be squeezed into that overstuffed backpack without causing damage to the hat.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Poly-straw | <strong>Size: </strong>One size | <strong>Number of Colors: </strong>22</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-floppy-san-diego-hat-company-shady-character-packable-wide-brim-hat></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Floppy</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>San Diego Hat Company Shady Character Packable Wide Brim Hat</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1026 data-sizes=750px alt="San Diego Hat Company Shady Character Packable Wide Brim Hat" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/7NAqd6f0UY5EHW_KD9YDYsuR0pY=/fit-in/1500x1026/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Screenshot2023-03-23at1.30.13PM-0cfaf0b78cc140958d3ec6bf33270b84.png"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Free People</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The trouble with large, floppy hats is you can rarely travel with them. Enter: this hat from the San Diego Hat Company. The hat folds up just as well as the others on this list despite its extra-large size. It won’t be as compact, but it can be easily tucked into the corner of a suitcase or weekender bag. When you unfold it, it bounces back to its regular size in order to properly cover your face and shoulders. It comes in six different shades of mostly neutrals, like chocolate brown and natural straw, plus one sunny yellow that more or less screams summer. Anello also tried this hat, sharing that the cap portion fits a bit large. It only comes in one size, though, so maybe skip to the next one if you think you have a smaller head size than most.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Paper, polyester | <strong>Size:</strong> OS | <strong>Colors:</strong> 6</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-colored-nordstrom-packable-floppy-hat></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Colored</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Nordstrom Packable Floppy Hat</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=959 data-sizes=750px alt="Nordstrom Packable Floppy Hat" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/KNuZDFg7wtcNQtGk5-jM3tHwnD4=/fit-in/1500x959/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/nordstrombestsunhats-f9408c81b5d445b8988572d847ee57b3.png"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=2><p>We love the pastel shades, instead of traditional tan shades, that add a bit more pizazz to beach attire.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re over the neutrals, opt for a hat with a bit of color like this one, which comes in a light blue, sage green, and lavender, instead of your basic tan. We appreciate It’s not too big or floppy like its other counterparts, but it still offers tons of character outside of its color selection, like the small bow wrapped around the crown, which we think adds a dainty touch. It does look a little less sophisticated than other hats on this list with tie details. But thanks to it being made from the same colored straw material, it still looks subtle. You can also adjust the fit of this hat by a small (unnoticeable) string to make sure its snug against your head.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Paper straw | <strong>Size:</strong> One size | <strong>Colors:</strong> 5</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-bucket-hat-lack-of-color-wave-bucket-hat></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Bucket Hat</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Lack of Color Wave Bucket Hat</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Lack of Color Wave Bucket Hat" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/8RldjQG35kSvOnVAXmay5544y1I=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Lack-of-Color-Wave-Bucket-Hat-c6895831883946ab9bb885d12af49110.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Lack of Color</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">I distinctly remember hating the bucket hats my mom would force me to wear on beach trips as a kid. Wearing one made me feel so uncool. Fast forward a few years, bucket hats are cool again, thanks to celebs like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Hailey Bieber and Kaia Gerber</a>, who have resurrected the style made famous by '90s street style icons and hip-hop artists. This hat from Lack of Color (which is anything but) won the top spot in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>our Best Bucket Hats </a>for a reason: It checks off all the boxes. Between the wide, circular brim that offers 360-degree sun protection and 16 fun colors to choose from, it's hard not to love this hat. Influencer Lindsay Silberman says she's "tried so many hat brands," but she always comes back to Lack of Color. "They offer classic styles but feel totally unique and really do hold their shape," she says. Between the retro terry cloth material, 15 color options (which include pastels and patterns), and a UPF 50+ rating, it's basically the perfect hat to roll up and bring with you on your next vacation.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Terry cloth | <strong>Size: </strong>S/M, M/L | <strong>Number of Colors: </strong>15</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-our-testing-process></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Our Testing Process</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To ensure that these hats actually fold up, we tested 10 of the 12 hats featured on this list. First, we evaluated the fit of each hat by trying it on. We looked at details like brim width and adjustability, noting if the cap portion felt comfortable to wear. We then folded each hat up, actually taking it on a vacation with us, or for the sake of the test, just putting it temporally into a bag we'd travel with, whether it be a duffel or a carry-on bag. We paid attention to how small it folded and how it looked as soon as we took it out: wrinkled, deformed, or completely normal. Once we had our favorites from testing, we considered other options on the market that might appeal to you, such as suggestions from our experts and internet favorites. We also thought about UPF ratings, color options, and different materials (since this isn't only about straw hats), giving you as well-rounded of a list as possible.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Material</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When looking for a sun hat, consider the material of the hat. If the fabric is uncomfortable, you won't get the most wear out of your hat. In addition, Silberman explains that the more durable the material of the hat, the better. "I've found that hats made out of straw are more sturdy and less likely to break compared to something more delicate," she says. Material also matters when it comes to packing. If the shape of your hat gets messed up while in transit, she recommends steaming the brim and then setting it on a table underneath something heavy like a set of books to get rid of creases and dents.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Style</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Keep in mind that although many hats come with a label that says "one size fits all," that's rarely true. To find a hat that actually fits if your head tends to be on either end of the size spectrum, look into options that come in a variety of sizes. Then, try measuring your head and comparing your measurements to those on the accompanying size guide. It's also helpful to consider options that feature adjustable cords that can alter the size a bit.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Sun Protection</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">According to Rodulfo, your first line of defense should always be <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>ample sunscreen application</a>.

Silberman tells InStyle, "When I'm on vacation, you'll catch me wearing a sun hat from the minute I wake up until the minute I go to sleep. Bad hair day? Throw on a sun hat. Worried about wrinkles? Sun hat. Too hungover to be seen in public at breakfast? Yep, you're gonna need a sun hat for that." Plus, she says, sun hats make for great photo props. "You'll feel 20 times less awkward posing for a photo if you're holding a hat in your hand."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What is UPF?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Not all fabrics are the same, especially when it comes to protecting skin from the sun. To determine how effectively a garment protects the skin from the sun, check its UPF (also known as ultraviolet protection factor) rating. UPF indicates how much UV radiation (both UVB and UVA) light a fabric allows to reach the skin. The highest a garment or accessory can rank is a UPF of 50, which blocks about 98 percent of the sun's rays, reducing your exposure significantly. So, when shopping for a sun hat, it's helpful to pick one with protection built in.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Caitlyn Martyn is a former commerce writer for&nbsp;InStyle&nbsp;who currently writes for Byrdie.
