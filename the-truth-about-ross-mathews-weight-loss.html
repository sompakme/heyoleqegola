He was also accustomed to late-night snacking. Eventually, he realized that wasn't the healthiest way to be and he decided to change his behavior. However, he didn't turn to a trendy diet or quick fix, he taught himself about food and healthier eating.</p><p dir=ltr>"It was about cutting out snacking," he said via Today. "Or if I did, I would snack on like a pickle or something. I was looking for the crunch. It was about replacing some things and really just knowing that if nothing changed, nothing changed. That if I didn't make some changes, I would be stuck in the same unhealthy place that I was."</p><p dir=ltr>In November, Mathews posted a photo of his <a href=#>dramatic weight loss</a> on his <a href=#>Instagram</a> and captioned it, "Breaking the pattern. 50lbs down today from my height in early June when I decided to reclaim my health after my mom died (70lbs down from my all-time). I will always be a work in progress. I may mess up again. I dunno. All I know is that I'm very grateful. And very happy. On we go..."</p><p dir=ltr>Mathews also mentioned that he recently moved to New York City and is walking more, which aided in his weight loss.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbWxjZoZze9OhnGasoqrBqXnAm6aurF2nvLS%2FjKaYraCVrMBuw8SinqGsXaG8tL%2BO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
