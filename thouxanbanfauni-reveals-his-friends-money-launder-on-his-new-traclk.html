In the past year, he's released countless songs and two projects,&nbsp;For Christ Sake 2 with UnoTheActivist which arrived in February, and August's&nbsp;Requiem.

The&nbsp;song initially popped up on Saturday but was quickly removed from streaming services before being added back onto Soundcloud. RXLVND and Thouxanbanfauni serve up a serious banger, detailing life in the streets and as the title suggests, laundering money. It's a trunk-rattling heater that finds Thouxanbanfauni delivering nothing short of a high-energy performance on the track. It's definitely going to hit hard during his live shows.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Peep Thouxanbanfauni's new track below and check out his episode of&nbsp;On The Come Up below.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span><strong>Quotable Lyrics<br></strong></span>You say you take risks but you too afraid to trap<br>I don't talk on the phone because I think it might be tapped<br>Told the bitch I need some alkaline, I don't drink tap</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Aron A. is a features editor for HotNewHipHop.
