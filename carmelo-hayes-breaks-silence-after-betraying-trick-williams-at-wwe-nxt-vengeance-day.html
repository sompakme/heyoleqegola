His friendship with Trick WIlliams was one of the best things about NXT but he ultimately <a href=#>betrayed him at NXT Vengeance Day</a> this week. Now, Hayes has broken his silence after the matter.</p><p>Trick Williams was attacked on NXT television a few months ago and the storyline suggested someone close to him was the attacker. All signs pointed towards Carmelo Hayes, but there was no conclusive proof about him being the attacker. This is despite Hayes displaying actions that hinted at attacking Williams.</p><p>It call came to ahead at NXT Vengeance Day, where Trick Williams failed to defeat Ilja Dragunov for the NXT Championship. Surprisingly, or perhaps not so surprising for many, Trick Williams was betrayed by <a href=#>Carmelo Hayes as the latter viciously attacked him after his loss</a>.</p><p>Following his shocking actions, Carmelo Hayes was asked about the reason for what he did. Hayes with a chair in hand kept it very short and simple as he took a shot at Williams’ catchphrase.</p><p>”Whooped.”</p><p>We will have to wait and see how WWE will be booking Carmelo Hayes and Trick Williams feud in the coming weeks, as fans certainly hate Hayes with pure passion right now after what he did to Trick Williams.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>What do you think of what Carmelo Hayes said?
