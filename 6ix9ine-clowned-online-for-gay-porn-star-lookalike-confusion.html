The controversial rapper is known for his colorful appearance and crazy antics. He often makes headlines for <a href=# rel>his outlandish behavior</a>. Sometimes, it's for <a href=# rel>making statements</a> people think are ridiculous. Other times, it's because of his <a href=# rel>continued use of slurs</a>. However, he found himself trending online for an unexpected reason recently. Apparently, 6ix9ine bears an extremely strong resemblance to a gay porn star.</p><p>The hilarious incident unfolded on Twitter, of course. An explicit video featuring a porn actor who bore a striking physical resemblance to the Brooklyn rapper began to circulate on the platform. Although the video has since been deleted, it sparked further discussion about 6ix9ine's sexuality. Fans who jumped in on the conversation shared a photo of the real rapper kissing another man on the cheek. This led to conversations and trolling surrounding the rapper's sexual orientation, adding to the viral moment and the online buzz surrounding him.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-6ix9ine-offered-50-million-to-fight-lil-durk>6ix9ine Offered $50 Million To Fight <a href=# class=text-word>Lil Durk</a></h2></span><p>Tekashi 6ix9ine performs in concert at Hovet on September 19, 2018 in Stockholm, Sweden. (Photo by MICHAEL CAMPANELLA/Redferns)</p><p>Unfortunately, 6ix9ine's <a href=# rel>offer to fight</a> Lil Durk probably didn't help the situation much. In fact, some were already trolling the rapper about his sexuality for his comments on the situation. It all started when Durk offered 6ix9ine $50 million to settle their beef in the ring. “I don’t want you hurt or dead you a kid from the burbs I got 50 million my own money without help to fight you on tv in dubi, we can double the money 3 rounds,” Lil Durk wrote in a DM to the Brooklyn rapper. However, 6ix9ine wasn't having any of it. He said that Durk was only asking him to do it because he had an album to promote.</p><p>"It’s so funny because I know you on album press run,” 6ix9ine said in response. “U need anything to promote this album since nba young boy not biting the bait. But I wanna fight you for now money pussy. For Free. Come to Miami let’s get a hotel room and just throw down 1 on 1.” Lil Durk, of course, declined the offer. Many fans pointed out that it was odd that 6ix9ine said they should meet in a hotel room. What do you think of the latest round of trolling that the rapper is experiencing?
