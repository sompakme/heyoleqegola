Her career first took off back in August 2022, following the release of her breakthrough single, “Munch (Feelin’ U).” In the months since, she’s collaborated with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Taylor Swift</a> and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Nicki Minaj</a>, while releasing several more hits. She recently discussed what it's been like reaching this level of fame with <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Teen Vogue</a>. Ice Spice revealed that remaining humble is what makes her most proud.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“I’m most proud of staying grounded so far because I’ve already been through so many things that I know a lot of people would’ve lost their f*cking minds,” she explained. “The whole lifestyle change is super drastic, especially coming from where I come from, not coming from sht and not having a lot growing up, to now — it’s the complete opposite…. Even though it’s a positive change, it’s still a change.”</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-ice-spice-performs-munch-feelin-u-more>Ice Spice Performs "Munch (Feelin' U)" & More</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Elsewhere in the night, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Busta Rhymes</a> accepted the Lifetime Achievement Award with an emotional speech, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Quavo</a> and Offset <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">reunited to honor Takeoff</a> and more.
