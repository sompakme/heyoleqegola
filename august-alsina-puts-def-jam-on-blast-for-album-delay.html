He hasn't really delivered much music for the most part and has been faced with some difficulties in both his professional and personal life. However, the fact that he hasn't delivered much music has less to do with him and more to do with a much bigger issue: Def Jam.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Alsina took to Twitter today to air out exactly why his third studio album hasn't dropped yet.&nbsp;He hasn't dropped an album since 2015's&nbsp;This Thing Called Life and his fans have been curious as to when they could expect a project from him. One fan in particular tweeted at him, asking when he'll drop. He replied to the fans inquiry, stating that he's been waiting to drop it but Def Jam has held him back from doing so. He said that he'll be releasing music soon but says that the label's held him hostage.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"I would love to put my album out but DEF JAM is holding it/me hostage because the system is not up & running until next year so they basically dont exist. The label is just TRASH .. I will release free music soon but that has been the hold up. Tell Them to FREE ME & the Album," he tweeted Monday afternoon.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Since then, his fans have been tweeting at him and Def Jam records with variations of the hashtag #FreeAugustAlsina.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The singer's already dropped off a slew of singles in anticipation for his upcoming project including "Drugs" and "Don't Matter."&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">This is just the latest issue he's had to deal with. Earlier in the year, he reportedly&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">flashed a gun to a group of fans</a> that approached him at a grocery store. The report said he told the fans that he wasn't feeling well, likely due to<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"> his liver disease</a>, but the fans continued to harass him which led him to show then butt end of the piece to them. He wasn't charged with anything and based on the fact that there was no physical evidence, the police didn't go after him for it.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Aron A. is a features editor for HotNewHipHop.
