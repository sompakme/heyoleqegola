Grenaway shared the allegations on Twitter/X earlier today, first unveiling a photo of a positive pregnancy test. "Happy early Mother’s Day to me! Y’all go tell Freddie Gibbs congratulations," she captioned the post.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">She went on to suggest that she had been warned about Gibbs, claiming that she should have listened. “I’m not above mistakes. I’ll admit, I should’ve listened to the warnings from everyone. But, here I am. I’m a real a** b*tch so I’ll take that on the chin. A sucka I am not tho," Grenaway wrote. From there, she posted a photo of <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">various bruises and marks</a> on her body. "Now that that’s out the way, here’s to the more serious part," she added.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-jasmine-grenaway-s-allegations-against-freddie-gibbs>Jasmine Grenaway's Allegations Against Freddie Gibbs</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“Why are y’all acting so confused? I said Freddie Gibbs put his hands on me, which <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">left scars and bruises</a>, then I found out I was pregnant and he won’t help me get the abortion bc he knows the risks due to my medical history of having cervical/ovarian tumors and a laparotomy. Like…," she alleged. Grenaway then responded to another Twitter user, who told her she should have contacted authorities. According to her, she did. “They literally held me down in a room while I was shouting ‘help, it’s domestic.’ And the police did not hear me. SMH. But I was still able to file charges," she claimed.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Grenaway went on to post a clip of herself, telling followers in her captioned “Here’s some beauty to brighten the day. I hope y’all enjoyed my exposé of my abuser. I’ll handle the rest of the matter privately. I have to focus on my children and my mental health. [kissing face emoji] be back soon.” Gibbs has since seemingly responded to the <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">allegations</a> with a vague Tweet. “The devil is a lie my n***a," he wrote today.
