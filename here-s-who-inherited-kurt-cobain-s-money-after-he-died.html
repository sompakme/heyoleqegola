In some cases, she sold off the rights to some of the ongoing income earned from Cobain's estate. In other situations, Love, who has long allegedly had her own addictions and psychiatric issues,&nbsp;<a href=#>lost millions</a> in lawsuits and settlements, some involving the other members of Nirvana.&nbsp;</p><p>Insider reported that Love once said, "I know that's a lifetime of money to most people, but I'm a big girl. It's rock 'n' roll. It's Nirvana money â€” I had to let it go. I make enough to live on. I'm financially solvent. I focus on what I make now."</p><p>For Frances' part, she filed a restraining order against her mother in 2009 and was ultimately taken from Love's custody. The mother and daughter have had a rocky relationship including occasional estrangement but in 2019,&nbsp;<a href=#>Page Six</a> reported that Frances and Love were working toward a more healthy relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>But Frances' relationship with her father's money was fraught with guilt. According to <a href=#>USA Today</a>, she said on the&nbsp;<a href=# data-t-l=":b|e|inline click|${u}">"RuPaul: What's the Tee?" podcast</a>, "My relationship to money is different because I didn't earn it. It's almost like this big, giant loan that I'll never get rid of. I have an almost foreign relationship to it or guilt because it feels like money from somebody that I've never met, let alone haven't earned myself."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCCkW1pa29fnbKzsdJmrqGnXZ67qbHRoquenF2gwrPAjJymm5mZo8Buuc6nnLJlkZvBpr6MoZxmnJmasXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
