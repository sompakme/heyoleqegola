Frank Sinatra and his fourth wife Barbara picked <span data-scayt_word="Melvyn's" data-scaytid=13>Melvyn’s</span> to host their wedding reception in 1976.</p><p>The Spanish-style inn was built as a private estate in 1925 before being transformed into a 20-room luxury hotel in the ‘<span data-scayt_word=30s data-scaytid=15>30s</span>. Back then, Howard Hughes, Clark Gable, Salvador Dali, Norman Vincent <span data-scayt_word=Peale data-scaytid=16>Peale</span>,&nbsp;Spencer Tracy, Elizabeth Taylor and Ava Gardner were frequent guests.</p><p><span data-scayt_word=Haber data-scaytid=19>Haber</span> — a Brooklyn native who had been in the business of manufacturing dashboard figures and other automotive accessories — purchased the inn, which had fallen into disrepair, for $300,000. He refurbished it for another $500,000, added the restaurant (named for the new owner) and opened it anew. It was an overnight success.</p><p>The Desert Sun newspaper <a href=# rel=nofollow>noted</a> that on 60 Minutes in 1979, Morley Safer quoted <span data-scayt_word=Haber data-scaytid=26>Haber</span> as saying that Palm Springs was the home of the&nbsp;“creme de la creme.” That made the folks who dined at <span data-scayt_word="Melvyn's" data-scaytid=27>Melvyn’s</span> “the creme de la creme of the creme de la creme.”</p><p><span data-scayt_word=Haber data-scaytid=30>Haber</span> also was profiled in The London Times, The New York Times and on TV’s Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.</p><p>“I am everything that’s wrong for this business,” he <a href=# rel=nofollow>said</a> in an interview in March. “I am not a foodie. I am not a wine connoisseur. I can’t cook a hamburger, make a Bloody Mary or open a cash register drawer. And I’m not into quaint, charming hotels. However, this property happens to be unique by itself. There’s a magic ambiance about it that I’ve come to appreciate.”</p><p>In 1979, <span data-scayt_word=Haber data-scaytid=33>Haber</span> launched a popular Palm Springs disco called Cecil’s. After selling it in 1994, he opened <span data-scayt_word=Touche data-scaytid=35>Touche</span>, a dance and dining club in nearby Rancho Mirage.</p><p>The irrepressible restaurateur documented his Hollywood encounters in a 1995 book, Bedtime Stories of the Legendary <span data-scayt_word=Ingleside data-scaytid=36>Ingleside</span> Inn. In 2009, he followed with Palm Springs a la Carte: The Colorful World of the Caviar Crowd at Their Favorite Desert Hideaway, co-written with Marshall <span data-scayt_word=Terrill data-scaytid=39>Terrill</span>.</p><p><span data-scayt_word=Haber data-scaytid=38>Haber</span> for years served as president of the Angel View Foundation, a charitable organization that aids children and adults with disabilities. A great ambassador for the city, he has a star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars and was known as “Mr. Palm Springs” around town.</p><p><span data-scayt_word="Melvyn's" data-scaytid=41>Melvyn’s</span>&nbsp;<span data-scayt_word="maitre'd" data-scaytid=43>maitre’d</span> Brian Ellis told the&nbsp;Sun that the inn and restaurant is being sold to a group of investors that include California Lt. <span data-scayt_word=Gov data-scaytid=44>Gov</span>. Gavin <span data-scayt_word=Newsom data-scaytid=50>Newsom</span>.</p><p><span data-scayt_word="Haber's" data-scaytid=20>Haber’s</span> survivors include his daughters&nbsp;Autumn and&nbsp;<span data-scayt_word=Shani data-scaytid=21>Shani</span> and son Gary <span data-scayt_word=Haber data-scaytid=17>Haber</span>.
