Furthermore, this information comes from court documents obtained by AllHipHop, which U.S. Attorney Damian Williams confirmed. For those unaware, officials arrested Taxstone (real name Daryl Campbell) in 2017 on charges related to a 2016 Irving Plaza shooting in New York City.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">An escalation between Tax and rapper <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Troy Ave</a> while a <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>T.I.</a> concert took place led to the death of Ave's bodyguard, Ronald "Banga" McPhatter. Also, the incident caused several injuries, including to Troy himself. Later, authorities charged Taxstone with various offenses like illegal possession of a firearm and second-degree murder. While he pled guilty to gun charges in June of 2017, he maintained his innocence when it came to murder charges. In the years since, Tax and Troy Ave <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">battled on social media</a> and gave each other various taunts and threats.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-the-court-delays-taxstone-s-sentencing>The Court Delays Taxstone's Sentencing</h2></span><p>NEW YORK, NY - AUGUST 11: (L-R) Loyal Duce, Taxstone, and Fame School Tell attend Highline Ballroom on August 11, 2015, in New York City.

"It’s been almost 7 years since I lost one of my closest friends&nbsp;#RIPBANGA, 7 years of a narrative about it being my fault, 7 years of my character being assassinated all the while Trying to defend myself without saying much!" The court also delayed his sentencing.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, District Attorney Alvin Bragg also addressed victory this case. "Daryl Campbell was convicted of killing a man and shooting three others during a tragic and deadly confrontation in a packed New York City music venue," he stated. "In addition to seriously injuring his rival and killing <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">his rival’s</a> bodyguard, Mr. Campbell shot innocent bystanders and put hundreds of other lives at risk. We will vigorously prosecute anyone who commits this type of deadly violence."
