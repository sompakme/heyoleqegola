They were cast as Lily Tucker-Pritchett after their mother, Michelle, "saw an ad on Craigslist [classified website] looking for identical Asian girl twins," she told <a href=#>Woman's Day</a>. "So we sent a picture and they were cast." According to Michelle, the girls were featured in 36 episodes, but by Season 2 she and her husband, Doug, noticed the girls didn't seem happy. They made the decision that it was time for the twins to retire from show biz, and they haven't acted since.</p><p dir=ltr>Aubrey Anderson-Emmons took over the role of Lily in Season 3, and for the first time Lily was part of storylines and had dialogue. As Lily's personality emerged, Aubrey played her with sassiness and boldness that was different from herself. "I don't relate to her too muchâ€”I'm not sassy or a brat!" she told <a href=#>Girls Life</a>. "I don't roast my mom 24/7 or walk in the room and do a line and walk out. It's great playing her but I'm not like her. She's definitely a character!"</p><p>Aubrey played the role of Emma Stelzer in 2014's "Distance," but hasn't had any other roles. She's pretty active on her social media accounts and has kept in touch with her "Modern Family" co-stars, posting an <a href=#>Instagram</a> photo of her and Jesse Tyler Ferguson hanging out in November, 2022. But other than that, she's just enjoying being a teenager.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbvOqZyrZpOkunB9kXJranBgZMSpu4ypo5qxo2K5qrjYZquum5uav2680aKrnKCVqcFuuc6dnKumXZuurrXLsmY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
