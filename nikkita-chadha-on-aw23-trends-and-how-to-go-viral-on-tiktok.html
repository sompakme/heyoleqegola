(It's worth noting she confirmed her is “really nice” - in case you needed just one more reason to love Idris.)</p><p id=e2PB1j9f6ny data-wc=28>Nikkita has teamed up with the e-commerce giant as part of its 2023 campaign, curating her own individual autumn/winter edit from its wide selection of designers and brands.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b6d8cd1cee03-uk-amazon-fashion-lookbook-aw23-uk-2.jpg><p id=eVVqTVjOloI data-wc=77>“We have thousands and thousands of brands, and that’s where working with influencers comes in,” Ruth Diaz, Vice President of Amazon Fashion EU told “We want customers to find everything they want that's inclusive of all styles, all sizes, and budgets,” she tells me. “From our <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>luxury store</a>, to well-known brands to emerging labels that are relevant for the local market.

So I'm kind of into that; constantly evolving.”</p><p id=eRnoIZr9MQx data-wc=96>Her edit spans from Salomons to satin cargos from Amazon’s own label <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>The Drop</a>, to rhinestone bags (that are absolutely on trend right now) and chunky boots from Pepe's Jeans - all of which are available to purchase directly via the online retailer. “This whole collection is day to night. The option to elevate everything is there,” she explains, “I wanted to keep this edit quite stripped back, almost ‘back to basics’. Interchangeable pieces that everyone can use. So it’s a bit more broad rather than one specific style, ‘cos I have so many different vibes”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c837946126f6-uk-amazon-fashion-lookbook-aw23-3.jpg><p id=ey-kP1Pcm9 data-wc=26><a class=hm-link href=#>Hello! Fashion</a><strong>'s Lauren Ramsay caught up with Nikkita to delve into her favourite fashion trends, her personal style and her AW23 edit with Amazon Fashion EU:</strong></p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>What are your favourite trends for AW23?</strong></h2><p id=ejVwWqi5N7FO data-wc=22>I love metallics. They’re vibes. Especially now we're going to like party season, it’s an easy way to elevate your everyday look.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/cf839bd012e1-uk-amazon-fashion-lookbook-aw23-6.jpg><h2 dir=ltr><strong>As a busy person, how do you balance style and comfort?</strong></h2><p id=e71G797w2csj data-wc=47>The best way to do that for me is by wearing tracksuits (but cool ones) Or comfy two pieces. The thing is, tracksuits are cool again. But also I think any matching set just looks like you've put a lot of effort in when you really haven't.</p><p id=e7DUPzMa6qcL data-wc=25>I live in tracksuits when I'm off-duty. Add a pair of boots and then a long jacket and it pulls you together. It's comfy chic.</p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>What are your must-have accessories?</strong></h2><p id=ePAHTkL39Qya data-wc=40>I really love earrings. I was going to say gold, but actually, I like mixing metals which is back in fashion. I think earrings always pop, and a pair of sunglasses is a must - they work all year round.</p><h2 data-gid=euwFaKPb8Cs dir=ltr><strong data-gid=eDaXt_rtky>What are your five must-have items in a winter wardrobe?</strong></h2><p id=e_tn0M1PNVy data-wc=62>Thermals are very important. A long jacket is a must-have, but so is a good cropped jacket for me because I ride a bike. I'm obsessed with fluffy socks. I’m also a fan of the balaclava hoods - I think they're so cute because they make you look really fancy, but also they're really warm and they can double as a scarf.</p><a title=@nikkitachadha href=#>@nikkitachadha</a><p>It’s balaclava szn baby <a title=ootd href=#>#ootd</a> <a title=fitcheck href=#>#fitcheck</a> <a title=autumn href=#>#autumn</a> <a title=fall href=#>#fall</a> <a title=londonfashion href=#>#londonfashion</a> <a title=streetstyle href=#>#streetstyle</a> <a title=outfitoftheday href=#>#outfitoftheday</a></p><a title="♬ Otra Vez - ProdMarvin" href=#>♬ Otra Vez - ProdMarvin</a><h2 dir=ltr><strong>Do you have any style influences? Who are they?</strong></h2><p id=eAXwV2tVUxTb data-wc=64>There are so many that I'm quite overwhelmed with influences. My friends are really influential - I always want to borrow their clothes! I wonder if it's because you love the person and you love their vibe and you wanna emulate that? My queer friends in the drag scene, then there's of course influencers, actors and celebrities… so no, I haven't really got one.</p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>You're an actress by trade, how did you get into fashion?</strong></h2><p id=emvd4vE-bSH8 data-wc=73>I think it was quite a natural step. When promoting projects, I started learning more about fashion, the red carpet, how to dress for photos, how to dress in real life etc. So it's been a natural development, but this is my first time doing an edit. I had free range to do whatever the hell I wanted and it was really fun. It's really cool and the options on Amazon are endless.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/88c6fc2bc036-uk-amazon-fashion-lookbook-aw23-2.jpg><h2 dir=ltr><strong>How do the two industries overlap?</strong></h2><p id=e1q2_D7VKIph data-wc=52>Fashion really helps you embody your character because it's the outside of you is the first thing the audience will see. Even though I’ve done all this practice for the internal work of a character and its emotions, the aesthetic is the first glimpse. What someone wears and what they look like.</p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>Is there a particular character you've played where you loved what they wore?</strong></h2><p id=e0XxbYBodbFS data-wc=28>When I was in both and . In Cinderella, I was wearing this incredible ball gown and thought “How can I incorporate this in my daily life?”&nbsp;</p><p id=ewTwwHiIQOR data-wc=17>It made me feel so elegant and powerful wearing all these incredible jewels. I really loved it.</p><a title=@nikkitachadha href=#>@nikkitachadha</a><p>BTS filming <a title=CinderellaMovie href=#>#cinderellamovie</a> @Prime Video UK @Amazon Prime Video <a title=princess href=#>#princess</a> <a title=indian href=#>#indian</a> <a title=JamieMovie href=#>#JamieMovie</a> <a title=TakingCareOfBiz href=#>#TakingCareOfBiz</a></p><a title="♬ Whatta Man / Seven Nation Army - Cinderella Original Motion Picture Cast & Nicholas Galitzine" href=#>♬ Whatta Man / Seven Nation Army - Cinderella Original Motion Picture Cast & Nicholas Galitzine</a><h2 dir=ltr><strong>Top tip for people trying to build a fashion or beauty page?</strong></h2><p id=efZtcXwJieBF data-wc=25>Don’t overthink TikTok. Instagram is way more curated - I'm probably thinking more about what looks good, but TikTok is just so quick and fun.</p><p id=e69kXP3vMkMxR data-wc=34>I’d say don't hesitate to post - Tiktok moves really quickly. The options to go viral are endless, and usually, you don't put much effort into go viral and you're like, oh my God.</p><p id=exu2tmqnBruy data-wc=13>So just hope for the best and post whatever the hell you want.</p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>What's your career highlight so far?</strong></h2><p id=e7vaLynd9pfk data-wc=39>There have been so many highlights, but I think being in an Oscar-winning short film (is kind of iconic. My friend who isn’t an actor was like “You've got an Oscar now, you’ve completed it, mate.”</p><p id=e3SK9AmO3n7P data-wc=16>I also think the message behind really was really important.
