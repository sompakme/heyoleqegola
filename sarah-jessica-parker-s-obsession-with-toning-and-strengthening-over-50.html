The actress reportedly loves to take part in a regular Barre workout at Physique 57 in New York. So what makes this such an effective workout?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/58c3dd71fd50-gettyimages-1328706967.jpg><p id=e32hbRYeLy3 data-wc=19><strong>HELLO! spoke to two Barre experts to get the full-low down on the actress' fitness obsession…</strong></p><h2 dir=ltr>What is a Barre workout?</h2><p id=eLwNYljcBFU data-wc=51>You may have visions of young children in tutus when you think of Barre, but it is a serious workout. Lottie Anderson, founder of <a class="hm-link noskim" href=# rel="noncommercial nofollow">Bondi Rise</a>, explains what it actually involves. "Barre is a dynamic fusion of Pilates, ballet, and fitness, using the classic ballet Barre and small equipment," she says.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">more celebrity workouts</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Jennifer Aniston's 'mindful' workout for super toned arms at 55" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/c43f53506ea0-jen-an-arms.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Jennifer Aniston's 'mindful' workout for super toned arms at 55" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Jennifer Aniston's 'mindful' workout for super toned arms at 55</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Brie Larson's 'disciplined' secret for super-toned Marvel figure" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/cf9ebdd5d250-brie-larson.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Brie Larson's 'disciplined' secret for super-toned Marvel figure" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Brie Larson's 'disciplined' secret for super-toned Marvel figure</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><h2 dir=ltr>Why have Barre workouts have increased in popularity in recent years?</h2><p id=egV1RjTfSnM data-wc=54>As with yoga and Pilates, Barre has seen a rise in popularity in recent years and has even gone TikTok-viral. Lottie explains why novices are turning to the Barre for a full-body burn. "With an emphasis on mindfulness and breath control, Barre classes offer participants improved flexibility, posture, and mental focus," the expert explains.&nbsp;</p><p id=ejKsf6dGP7 data-wc=24>"Additionally, the accessibility of Barre workouts has made them appealing to a wide range of individuals looking for a challenging yet inclusive fitness option."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ad71530bd158-barre-class.jpg><p id=eadl2W0TdJT data-wc=55>Barre isn't just an excuse to invest in some cute yoga leggings - it offers a range of bodily benefits. Paola di Lanzo, founder of <a class="hm-link noskim" href=# rel="noncommercial nofollow">Paola's Body Barre</a>, explains that the benefits of Barre workouts are six-fold: muscle-toning, improved flexibility, improved posture, increased endurance, enhanced balance, it is low impact making it safer on joints.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7fc0ce80858e-barre-fitnesss.jpg><h2 dir=ltr>Why is Barre a great workout for over the 50s?</h2><p id=eLPs5KAPSsg data-wc=40>Despite Barre's popularity amongst Gen Z TikTok users, it is an exceptionally effective workout for women over 50, like SJP. "I, for one, am going through perimenopause at present and the benefits for me extend beyond the physical," admits Paola.&nbsp;</p><p id=eamQO4wHjS data-wc=42>"It is well known that women over 50 suffer from muscle deterioration and lower bone density, which Barre can help counteract, but at the same time, it's the mental clarity that Barre provides that helps those going through things such as menopause."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/cc967d694556-women-barre-class.jpg><p id=eoRzEu6BZ7_ data-wc=33>Lottie concurs. "It targets multiple muscle groups simultaneously, promoting stability, balance, and flexibility," she says. "Its emphasis on mindfulness fosters a strong mind-body connection, while the cardiovascular component boosts heart health and endurance."</p><h2 dir=ltr>Getting into Barre as a beginner</h2><p id=eFfOImCvZNj data-wc=51>The safest way to get into Barre, our experts say, is to find a local class where you can be led by a qualified instructor. Paola does, however, say that beginners can start by buying a resistance band, a set of light hand weights and ankle weights, and a Pilates ball.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e98692c6676f-barre.jpg><p id=eqpL5IzplKB data-wc=66>Complete novices may struggle to spot the signs of a safe and effective Barre class - but Lottie is on hand to help. "A good Barre class effectively challenges participants while emphasising proper form and technique," the Barre instructor explains. "I always recommend finding friendly instructors who are hands-on so they can ensure your form is correct, and therefore getting the most out of your workout.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/793d0a002aca-barre-workout.jpg><p id=e8wwv-_dASI data-wc=22>"With motivating cues, upbeat music, and a supportive atmosphere, participants leave feeling energized, accomplished, and with improved strength, flexibility, and overall wellbeing."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/44210e41495c-sarah-jessica-parker.jpg><p id=eHYGfzHk1cV data-wc=72>Paola recommends a class lasting between 45 and 60 minutes. "The more rigorous, cardio classes tend to be set at 45 minutes," she tells us. "Barre workouts are an excellent form of exercise to introduce to your weekly routine, whether you combine it with strength classes, running, spinning or any other form of exercise. If it’s combined with other style workouts one to two classes a week would be a great complement."</p><h2 dir=ltr>When will you start to see results?</h2><p id=elm1jWoxmVQ data-wc=32>Lottie reminds us that the timeframe for seeing results with a Barre workout can vary depending on factors such as individual fitness level, a balanced diet, consistency of practice, and specific goals.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/46f8675f6c68-sarah-jessica-parker-emmys.jpg><p id=edHxeo4RWRz data-wc=32>However, she does say that "many people may start to notice improvements in strength, flexibility, and muscle tone within a few weeks of regular practice, typically 3 to 4 times per week."</p><p id=ezuDvgbNw-I data-wc=35>She adds: "It's important to remember that progress is gradual and may vary from person to person, so staying committed to your Barre practice and maintaining a balanced lifestyle are key to achieving long-lasting results."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/bcc558e25e92-gettyimages-1663476288.jpg><p id=eyTdWd7-qq data-wc=13><strong>DISCOVER:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>Jennifer Aniston's viral 15-15-15 workout builds 'strength and endurance' for over 50s&nbsp;</a></p><p id=eAgI7ijgNV0 data-wc=24>Paola keeps it simple - "After one session, you will feel the difference mentally, and after 10 sessions you will notice the difference physically."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
