While Knight is one of the most over WWE Superstars right now, it appears he attacked The Miz’s lack of appeal ahead of WWE Payback.</p><p>The former NXT Superstar has organically gotten over with fans due to his ability to connect with the audience, which is mostly because of his incredible work on the microphone.</p><p>LA Knight has been engaged in a feud with The Miz for the past few weeks on Monday Night RAW. Even during Smackdown this week, LA Knight called out The Miz after delivering a touching tribute to Bray Wyatt.</p><p>While speaking on SmackDown LowDown, LA Knight continued to go after The Miz as he attacked The Miz’s lack of sex appeal, stating that he has the appeal of a clogged toilet.</p><p>“He talks about his wife. He always wants to brag about his wife, doesn’t he? I gotta tell you what man. I gotta hand it to you. It is a major accomplishment for you to have bagged her. Because here is the deal man. You got the sex appeal of a clogged toilet as far as I’m concerned.”</p><p>It remains to be seen whether LA Knight will be able to defeat The Miz at the WWE Payback Premium Live Event on September 2nd. After all, fans simply want LA Knight to succeed in WWE.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>What’s your take on what LA Knight said?
