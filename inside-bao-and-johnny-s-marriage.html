He sounded furious." Nevertheless, Johnny went through with the wedding. In the <a href=#>clip</a>, Bao was breathtaking in a show-stopping dress, while the groom was on fleek in a red velvet suit and bow tie. But, as the bride made her way down the aisle, their eyes locked, then widened as they instantly recognized each other.</p><p>"I know him," Bao told her dad. "You're all red, Johnny" were her first words to her in front of the altar. He laughed, blushed, and kept it 100, "I am." Mood: awkward much! Evidently, Bao and Johnny knew each other, but that did not stop them from going through with the nuptials. They also had a tea ceremony afterward. Via <a href=#>The List</a>, now-married Johnny revealed that he asked for a traditional Chinese tea ceremony, but "ended up doing Vietnamese tea ceremony, which is not that far off. It's just a little bit more glam."</p><p>Before the show, Bao mused that she may already know her match if he was part of the Asian community in Houston, per <a href=#>Distractify</a>. How accurate was her hunch, though! As she told Dr. Viviana, she could overlook perhaps knowing him as long as her future husband could "demonstrate that they have strong family values." Only time will tell if they will have a happily ever after.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbW5nbYJ3e8yaqauhlZl6osCMn6Crq6RiwKqzx61koqajnrGmecGapmaZnpl6q7vHp6Wyq12irrO%2ByJqenmc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
