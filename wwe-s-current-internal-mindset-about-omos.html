That being said, Vince McMahon isn’t around to book anymore. Triple H may have a different way of dealing with that kind of talent.</p><p>Omos hasn’t been seen on WWE television since SummerSlam. <a href=#>The big man does show up at live events</a>, but nothing came of it on television.</p><p>Sean Sapp noted behind Fightful’s paywall that there is a belief within WWE that Omos could be used as an attraction Superstar. He doesn’t need to be on television each week, but his live event appearances are likely to continue.</p><p>Omos has not been used on WWE TV since SummerSlam, when he returned…after almost never being used on television since WrestleMania. Sources in WWE told us they feel like Omos can be used in the attraction role, but there haven’t been many creative pitches thrown his way. However, he wrestles semi-regularly on live events, usually against the likes of Akira Tozawa.</p><p>Omos is a special talent, and he is able to hit a lot of marks. Only time will tell how even more time in the ring will help improve him, so he may return to WWE television with even more abilities.</p><p>We will have to see how Triple H handles Omos at this point. Vince McMahon loved booking Omos in big matches, but the Nigerian Giant hasn’t been seen in months under Triple H’s watch.</p><p>What’s your take on WWE’s treatment of Omos?
