This article delves into the twists and turns of Baker Mayfield’s career, examining the factors that have influenced his trajectory in the NFL.</p><h2 id=early-promise-and-success-BYNBgIiNAY>Early Promise and Success</h2><p>Baker Mayfield burst onto the NFL scene with a bang. Drafted by the Cleveland Browns, he was seen as a beacon of hope for a franchise that had long struggled to find a franchise quarterback. Mayfield’s rookie season was impressive, as he broke the NFL record for touchdown passes by a rookie and led the Browns to a significant improvement in their win-loss record.</p><ul><li>Set rookie touchdown pass record with 27 TDs</li><li>Named PFWA Rookie of the Year</li><li>Helped Browns improve from 0-16 to 7-8-1</li></ul><h2 id=signs-of-trouble-BYNBgIiNAY>Signs of Trouble</h2><p>Despite a strong start, Mayfield’s performance began to waver in his second season.
