Bassey lived in Oron, <a href=#>Akwa Ibom state</a>, at the time they met. His girlfriend relocated to Eket, and this change of town almost ended their relationship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d549758f9c6c7e9b.png><p class=align-left>She was his first girlfriend, and he had her in his heart even when he, too, left Oron for Calabar to further his <a href=#>education</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/5a6c6d209332896d.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jnr Pope: Ruth Kadiri appreciates Regina Daniels, AGN for trying to save actor, "Stayed till 3 am"</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In an interview with <strong>Legit.ng,</strong> Bassey recalled:</p>"My wife was my first girlfriend in life (2012) as an adolescent, and just when we were trying to get more serious, she left Oron town to Eket to finish Secondary school, while I left for Calabar for further studies. Just 2020, fate brought us together again, and we had to continue our relationship, and this time, I couldn't let her go anywhere by engaging her; then she started school, and then we got married on 7th September 2023."<h2>How man sent his girlfriend to school</h2><p class=align-left>After they were reunited, Endurance expressed a strong desire to still go to school as she only completed her secondary education.
