Using prosthetics and a balding grey wig, the film captures Artie's elderly appearance, and with a suit bedecked with war medals, Pierce's portrayal emanates the aura of a dignified veteran.&nbsp;</p><p id=e66FEuWqsJ0 data-wc=44>A teaser from the film captivated audiences, stating: “@piercebrosnanofficial as 92-year-old WWII veteran Artie in The Last Rifleman will make you believe in humanity again.Artie’s epic journey to attend the anniversary of the D-Day landings is a true tale. Coming to Sky Cinema soon.”</p><p id=emXgkBJ5LgM data-wc=27>This wartime film recounts the real-life adventures of Royal Navy Lieutenant Jordan, who, at 89, made headlines in 2014 for his audacious escape from his care home.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/316aa8aa512e-pierce-brosnan-the-last-rifleman-653a2fcadd1df.jpg><p id=e_E5sMSToYJ data-wc=27>Intent on commemorating the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Normandy, Bernard deceived his care home staff, saying he was merely 'popping down to the shops'.&nbsp;</p><p id=epvXDX1-sVy data-wc=38>In reality, he journeyed from Brighton Railway station to Portsmouth, eventually taking a ferry to Caen. Successfully, he participated in the events, paying tribute with hundreds of fellow veterans to those who sacrificed their lives during the war.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f6eb0c79af80-the-last-rifleman-pierce-brosnan-653a2fd0120bf.jpg><p id=eW1kd-nBHb7 data-wc=44>As Bernard was immersed in the D-Day ceremonies, back home, a frantic cross-channel search and rescue operation was underway to find him. His escapade was so noteworthy that it was featured on the Mail's front page, leading to his endearing moniker, The Great Escaper.</p><p id=eIYdg4TYADC data-wc=24>Reflecting on his impromptu journey, Bernard said: "My thoughts were with my mates who had been killed. I was going to pay my respects."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/764ec0f5be73-pierce-brosnan-keely-shaye-sons-paris-dylan-thomas.jpg><p id=eJme32P4cXp data-wc=31>He elaborated further on what drove him: "In the months leading up to the anniversary, I tried to get an official trip to Normandy, but I didn’t have the necessary passes.&nbsp;</p><p id=eeHOtcBsjI9 data-wc=25>“Seeing all the TV coverage the day before D-Day, I felt, 'I have to go and be part of it.' I was naughty and secretive."&nbsp;</p><p id=edkqIsk4x5K data-wc=36>Tragically, Bernie passed away in January of the subsequent year, and his beloved childhood companion, Irene, departed a mere week after. They generously bequeathed their £600,000 estate to the RNLI, as the couple had no children.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ceb0e197c7d7-pierce-brosnan-keely-shaye-date.jpg><p id=eDeJFZdmwgw data-wc=23>Bernard's heartwarming story has garnered significant attention.
