Here are all the facts...</p><li class=collection__item readability=22><h2 class=title>Who wrote 'Only You'?</h2><p class=paragraph-text>In 1981, Vince Clarke left Depeche Mode, citing touring fatigue and a growing disdain for pop fame as his reasons for the departure.</p><p class=paragraph-text>Worried that Mute Records would drop him as a result, he decided to write a song for the label called 'Only You'.</p><p class=paragraph-text>Clarke originally wrote the music for the song on a guitar, and later converted the riff into synthesizer notes.</p><p class=paragraph-text>While writing the lyrics, Clarke said: "It was a very simple arrangement. I just formed words on a piece of paper. I was just hoping Daniel Miller, Mute Records founder, would like it".</p><p class=paragraph-text>However, Before Clarke gave the song to Miller, he offered the song to Andy Fletcher and Martin Gore of Depeche Mode, but they declined.</p></li><li class=collection__item readability=37><h2 class=title>How did Alison Moyet join Yazoo?</h2><figure><span class=attribution>Picture: BBC</span></figure><p class=paragraph-text>Clarke wrote 'Only You' as a sentimental ballad, and wanted to find a singer who could perform it with emotion.</p><p class=paragraph-text>At the same time, The Screamin' Ab Dabs split, and singer Alison Moyet placed an ad in Melody Maker looking for a new band.</p><p class=paragraph-text>Clarke had heard Moyet perform with other bands on the pub circuit, and felt she was a perfect fit for the song. He replied to the ad and asked Moyet if she was interested in singing for a demo.</p><p class=paragraph-text>Although reluctant at first, as she never wanted to perform pop songs at the time, she eventually agreed. Moyet later said: "A part of me was thinking I'll never hear the end of it if I go and sing with this pretty boy".</p><p class=paragraph-text>After recording a demo on a four-track tape recorder, Clarke gave it to Miller, who at first wasn't much of a fan. Later that day, publishing associates from Scandinavia heard the demo and liked it, which Clarke later suggested may have influenced Miller's opinion.</p><p class=paragraph-text>A week later, Miller told Clarke that he and Moyet should re-record the song as a group and release it as a single. Moyet was surprised, as neither she or Clarke had intended to start a band together, and knew virtually nothing about each other.</p><p class=paragraph-text>Moyet described the pairing as "almost like an arranged marriage". The new duo chose the name Yazoo from the specialist blues record label, Yazoo Records. This decision led to a Â£3.5 million lawsuit threat by the label, and the group were renamed Yaz in the US.</p></li><li class=collection__item readability=8><h2 class=title>What inspired 'Only You'?</h2><p class=paragraph-text>'Only You' is considered a 'torch song', and is about the end of a relationship.</p><p class=paragraph-text>The singer knows the difficult relationship is over, but desperately hopes to be proven wrong.</p><p class=paragraph-text>NME noted how the song could have initially been about Clarke's uneasy relationship with Depeche Mode, but Moyet then turned the lyrics into the story of a person "looking through a scrapbook of photo-like memories".</p></li><li class=collection__item readability=3><h2 class=title>How did it perform in the charts?</h2><figure><span class=attribution>Picture: BBC</span></figure><p class=paragraph-text>'Only You' reached number two in the UK chart, behind Nicole's Eurovision-winning song 'A Little Peace'.</p><p class=paragraph-text>It only peaked at number 67 in the US.</p></li><li class=collection__item><h2 class=title>We have no idea why they chose this as the cover art</h2><figure><span class=attribution>Picture: Mute</span></figure></li><li class=collection__item readability=10><h2 class=title>The Flying Pickets scored a huge number one with a cover</h2><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.ytimg.com/vi/qgDKtLPp46s/hqdefault.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Flying Pickets - Only You</p><p class=paragraph-text>An a cappella version by The Flying Pickets proved even more successful, after it was released the following year.</p><p class=paragraph-text>It reached the top spot, and even won the Christmas number one for 1983. It was also the first a cappella chart-topper in the UK.</p><p class=paragraph-text>Because of this, 'Only You' has often been associated with Christmas, with subsequent cover versions having a festive feel to it.</p></li><li class=collection__item readability=0><h2 class=title>Who else has covered it?</h2><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.ytimg.com/vi/LKzWnjmiWYk/hqdefault.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Joshua Radin-Only You (Yaz Cover)</p><p class=paragraph-text>Many!
