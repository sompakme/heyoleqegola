I'm in a relationship that is with one of the most beautiful people I've met in life."</p><p>He continued, "She's smart, she loves God, she has something real down to earth about her. She's talented. But I set my standard kinda high, 'cause she had to have an EGOT. She had to win an Oscar on her first movie. She had to get her own talk show."</p><p>Hudson and Common first sparked relationship rumors in November 2022, when they were photographed holding hands, according to <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.etonline.com/jennifer-hudson-and-common-seemingly-confirm-their-romance-this-relationship-is-a-happy-place referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Entertainment Tonight</a>. Around the same time, Hudson confirmed in as many words that she was in a relationship, though she didn't reveal with whom.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VHKaa7H6nmdEPdktawuesW-1920-80.jpg><p>As for the attributes Common listed about his belle, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/jennifer-hudson-crashes-couples-wedding-reception-performs/>Hudson</a> become an "EGOT" winner in June 2022, after she took home a Tony Award for her producing role on A Strange Loop, which was crowned best musical that year, per <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://edition.cnn.com/2022/06/13/entertainment/jennifer-hudson-tonys-egot/index.html referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>CNN</a>. She is the proud owner of a Daytime Emmy for the animated short "Baba Yag," two Grammys, and an Oscar for best supporting actress in Dreamgirls.</p><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/mariah-carey-doesnt-have-a-drivers-license/>Hudson</a> is one of only <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/arts-and-culture/g23064962/egot-winners-full-list/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>19 people</a> to ever achieve EGOT status, the other women being Viola Davis, Rita Moreno, Whoopi Goldberg, Audrey Hepburn, and Helen Hayes.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

"Are you happy in your relationship?"</p><p>The Selma actor replied, "This relationship is a happy place for me. For me, it's one of those things where I found where I can—seeing her happy actually makes me really happy. I'm very grateful. I thank God each and every day, and I'm just letting God guide this relationship."</p><p>On a different note, Common <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/doing-well-common/>recently opened up to Marie Claire</a> about his best advice for feeling happy and well, in case you'd like to learn from him!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJuVobKjvsitsGiilaO7qrLEq2ShrZSovK95wqikpqeeYrGiwMinnmaqpaK8s7%2BO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
