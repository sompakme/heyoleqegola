A new episode premieres tonight, and based on various previews, things pop off. In one clip, the tension appears to surround Woah Vicky, who's seen being chased and then hit multiple times. It's not the first time Vicky's gotten into it with the cast, as she's had beef before with <a href=# class=text-word rel>Chrisean Rock</a> and her sister, Tesehki.</p><p>In a previous episode, Chrisean Rock confronted her for liking shady Tweets about her relationship with Blueface, who she just welcomed her first child with. While Vicky denied intentionally upsetting her, Chrisean wasn't having it. She encouraged Tesehki to hit her, as she couldn't herself since she was pregnant. Tesehki refused, however, claiming that it wasn't the right thing to do. Unfortunately, it looks like other cast members feel as though Vicky is fair game, as the devout Christian is said to <a href=# rel>get her "a** whooped for Christ"</a> in tonight's episode.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>Chrisean Rock And Natalie Nunn Exchange Heated Words On “Baddies East”</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-chaos-ensues-on-baddies-east>Chaos Ensues On Baddies East</h2></span><p>The drama doesn't stop there, however. Tesehki is also seen getting into a fight with Chrisean's friends. Mariahlynn then jumps in, and Chrisean <a href=# rel>tells her to stay out of it</a> and mind her own business. According to her, her friends were simply defending her as she claims that Tesehki threatened to hit her while she was pregnant. In a different preview, the ladies are seen traveling to Philly, where another fight ensues after Natalie Nunn encourages the group to <a href=# rel>squash any lingering beef</a>. Viewers also get to see performances from Chrisean and Tesehki.</p><p>Clearly, it doesn't look like tension among the cast will be dying down any time soon.
