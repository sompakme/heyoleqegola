It was a decision she would regret, she explained in a <a rel=nofollow href=#>2009 interview</a>.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I finally had a chance to go to Hollywood and become a worldwide name. It was the stuff dreams are made of, but I didn’t get to enjoy it like I should have,” she said. “When I arrived, I was so panicked and tired and the sun was just too yellow and the orange juice too orange. It was very stressful, and I had a headache all the time.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In <a href=#>Lewis Gilbert</a>’s Alfie (1966), she played a nurse named Carla seduced by <a href=# id=auto-tag_michael-caine_1 data-tag=michael-caine>Michael Caine</a>’s iconic womanizer.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Field’s outstanding body of work also included The Damned (1962) with Oliver Reed, Lunch Hour (1963) with Robert Stephens, Kings of the Sun (1963) with Yul Brynner, Doctor in Clover with <a href=#>Leslie Phillips</a>, My Beautiful Laundrette (1985) with <a href=# id=auto-tag_daniel-day-lewis_1 data-tag=daniel-day-lewis>Daniel Day-Lewis</a>, The Rachel Papers (1989) with Dexter Fletcher and Hear My Song (1991) with <a href=#>Ned Beatty</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/MBDENTE_EC022-EMBED-2023.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Shirley Broomfield — named after <a href=#>Shirley Temple</a> — was born in London on June 27, 1936, and raised in a series of children’s homes with her younger brother.
