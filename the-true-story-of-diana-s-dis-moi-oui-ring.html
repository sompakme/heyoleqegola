She declines, politely. The ring cycle of this episode begins with an escape from paparazzi in Monte Carlo, into the Repossi jewellery store, where an advertisement for a diamond dome ring called the ‘Dis Moi Oui’ (which loosely translates as 'say yes to me') hangs on the wall. It catches Dodi’s eye. Does Diana like it? Sure, she says. A few days later they are in Paris, there is another trip to Repossi’s Place Vendome store and then a request from Dodi to the staff to fill the room with “roses, lots of roses”. The attempted proposal in the episode ends up happening with no flowers in sight – but with the Repossi ring in hand.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for The Crown: Season 6 | Part 1 Trailer" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/screenshot-2023-12-21-at-12-22-44-65842e7987b68.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 data-node-id=3 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Did Dodi propose to Diana?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The source of the engagement story seems to mainly be a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/diana/stories/paris0909.htm data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Washington Post article" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Washington Post article</a> that ran on 9 September 1997, which included an interview with Alberto Repossi, son of the founder Costantino Repossi, who founded the house in Turin in 1957 (Alberto took over in 1974). The piece details the purchase of the ring during the couple’s visit to Repossi’s Monaco store.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Was it an engagement ring? Repossi explained that there was no discussion of it as such but did add that it was designed as one – hence its romantic name. The ring, according to the article, was sent to Paris for sizing and Dodi Fayed picked it up from there. But how did the press find out about it, and where did the engagement rumours begin?</p><img alt="a gold ring with diamonds" title="a gold ring with diamonds" width=1568 height=2048 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/ap-i-fra-par102-file-france-diana-ring-97090802265-654e612902c7e.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">AP Photo</span><p>The diamond ring, seen in this undated photo released Monday September 8, 1997, was found in the wrecked car following the crash.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Someone at Lloyd's [the insurance company] must have told the press,” Repossi said. “I would never have spoken of the ring if it had not already been revealed. My pain does not permit me to rejoice in the publicity.” In 2004, when Repossi opened a New York store on Madison Avenue, the story of the ring and the engagement was repeated in an article that ran in WWD. The ring is mentioned along with its value – an estimated $200,000 – and it is referred to as a potential engagement ring for Diana, purchased hours before their fatal crash.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“It was a love story,” Repossi said then, “but also a tragedy.”</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=11 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Is The Crown's re-telling accurate?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Well, there was a ‘Dis Moi Oui’ Repossi collection and this ring, one of their signature domes, with a centre emerald-cut diamond and triangular diamonds surrounding it, did exist. There was a Repossi store in Monaco established in 1978, and one in Paris opened in 1986. They have always had ties to celebrities and aristocrats and are the official jewellers to the House of Monaco. They also definitely did design the ring for one royal bride: <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.townandcountrymag.com/society/tradition/g40231148/princess-charlene-monaco-fashion-photos/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Princess Charlene of Monaco." class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Princess Charlene of Monaco.</a></p><img alt="diana repossi" title=DIANA-REPOSSI width=1380 height=2048 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/client-leaves-the-jewellery-shop-repossi-in-paris-04-news-photo-1700497196.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">GABRIEL BOUYS</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>A client leaves the Repossi boutique in Paris, September 4, 1997.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But this Repossi ring, if anything, seems to be another of Dodi Al Fayed’s grand gestures. The season opens with him sending Diana a gold and diamond <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/jewellery-watches/a41241604/cartier-tank/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Cartier watch" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Cartier watch</a> as a gift. Later, in a phone call, she recounts another present: a poem engraved on a silver platter. There is no record of the ring or the engagement in any of Repossi’s current communication, and when we talked to people who worked at the New York store, they do not remember ever hearing about it. Given the public fascination with Diana, one would assume that had it actually been an engagement ring, they would have.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Let’s also consider this: would Dodi have bought Diana a widely marketed diamond cocktail ring to propose? It wasn’t custom – Diana’s first <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/jewellery-watches/g43889665/sapphire-engagement-rings/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="sapphire ring" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">sapphire ring</a> famously wasn’t either, but that central stone was certainly impressive – and despite the name of the collection it veers from the traditional design of an engagement ring. The dome was a signature of Repossi’s work at the time, as is the visible gold in between the stones.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Is the ring available to buy?</h2><img alt="st tropez, france july 17 1997 file photo diana, princess of wales and son hrh prince william are seen holidaying with dodi al fayed not pictured in st tropez in the summer of 1997, shortly before diana and dodi were killed in a car crash in paris on august 31, 1997 the inquests into both of their deaths are due to start in early 2004 photo by michel dufourwireimage" title="FILE PHOTO Dodi Al Fayed And Diana, Princess Of Wales" width=2999 height=1887 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-2827407-6554c11279acc.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Michel Dufour</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Diana and Dodi on holiday together in 1997</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 2007, Gaia Repossi, Alberto’s daughter, took over the family business and radically <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://repossi.com data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="transformed the aesthetic" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">transformed the aesthetic</a>.
