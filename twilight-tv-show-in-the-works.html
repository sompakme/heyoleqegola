Sources say Daly is working with <a href=# id=auto-tag_lionsgate-tv data-tag=lionsgate-tv>Lionsgate TV</a> to determine what the specific take on Twilight will be and if it will be a remake of Meyer’s books or a different offshoot.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The Twilight TV series is in its infancy and does not yet have a network/platform as sources say the studio, which controls the rights to the franchise, plans to lead the development on the project before shopping the rights to the package. There is not yet a timeline for when the Twilight series will be taken out to potential buyers.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Sources say author Meyer is expected to be involved in the television adaptation. Wyck Godfrey and former Lionsgate Motion Picture Group co-president Erik Feig, who during his tenure at Summit Entertainment bought the rights to the Twilight book series after Paramount Pictures passed, are both attached to exec produce the television take. Godfrey’s Temple Hill banner produced all five of the movies that Feig’s Summit distributed. The film franchise, which made stars of Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner, collectively grossed more than $3.4 billion worldwide. &nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Reps for Lionsgate Television declined to comment.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Twilight is a major piece of Lionsgate’s library. In 2017, five years after Breaking Dawn: Part 2 wrapped up Meyer’s film adaptation, Lionsgate CEO Jon Feltheimer told Wall Street during an earnings call that “there are a lot more stories to be told, and we’re ready to tell them when our creators are ready to tell those stories,” in reference to both Twilight and The Hunger Games franchises.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Word of a Twilight TV series comes as Lionsgate has been negotiating with multiple bidders to potentially spin off its studio business and premium cable network Starz by the end of September 2023. The Lionsgate studio business, which includes film and TV production divisions, grew revenue 25 percent to nearly $900 million in the third quarter.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Lionsgate TV also recently announced plans to revive Spartacus with a sequel series from creator Steven S. DeKnight. Lionsgate TV produced both Spartacus: Blood and Sand and the prequel miniseries Gods of the Arena as the franchise also remains a valuable piece of the studio’s library. Lionsgate and Starz also recently <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">revived Party Down</a>, and the studio has been exploring a sequel to former Showtime comedy Weeds, as reboots remain easier to both market and cut through the clutter while also helping to increase the value of years-old library titles.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The Twilight films recently moved their streaming home to NBCUniversal’s Peacock after a stint at Netflix.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The timing of the Twilight series comes as HBO Max recently confirmed that it was in early development of a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Harry Potter television adaptation</a> with plans for a decade-long run of J.K. Rowling’s beloved book series with the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>controversial author attached</a> as an executive producer. Genre programming continues to remain in high demand as Amazon last year launched a new take on The Lord of the Rings, with Warner Bros. Discovery also planning on making new installments of the feature films based on the J.R.R. Tolkien works.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Daly is repped by WME, Kaplan/Perrone Entertainment and attorney Ashley Silver.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOra6ipJmctbV5069krJ2inrK0ecinZK2glWLEsL7KrGRqamNqgHp9lmpnaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
