As we have reported extensively, Pina is being accused of running a real estate fraud scheme. Furthermore, Envy is implicated in all of this due to the fact that he was a big promoter of Pina's business. They even did seminars together which has subsequently furthered the allegations. As for Budden, he felt like all of this was a scam from the beginning. He even<a href=# rel> told Envy that during a phone call.</a></p><p>“I think this is very very severe,” Budden said on a previous podcast. “I’m not certain I’m not certain how big this is but I think it’s going to be way bigger than this.
