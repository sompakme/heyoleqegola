He said, â€˜Yâ€™all n-ggas is not having them morning meetings with yourself in the mirror.â€™ You know, that three second to 33 second meeting with yourself in the mirror. Cause yâ€™all n-ggas is just running around saying everything. How is your man getting a blowjob in the backseat change your life? He getting his d-ck sucked â€” pause â€” but it changed your life? Why are you commenting on that n-gga getting fellatioâ€™d and you wasnâ€™t even getting fellatio?" Killa asked on It Is What It Is.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">However, Cam'ron is not the only person who has been sounding off on Young for his comments. Patrick Beverley has defended Michele after Young's story. "Sidenote Yal foul. Not cool, not at all. @GilsArenaShow Yal old asl talking about another man Lady. Not cool gang. @PatBevPod," Beverley wrote on X, formerly Twitter. However many people in Beverley's comments tried to defend Young and Arenas, saying the two men were just trying to "warn" Green about Michele.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-fans-call-out-neighborhood-talk-for-comparing-joie-chavis-amp-trevon-diggs-to-draya-michele-amp-jalen-green>Fans Call Out Neighborhood Talk For Comparing Joie Chavis & Trevon Diggs To Draya Michele & Jalen Green</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">However, it's not just Young catching heat for his comments about Michele. The Neighborhood Talk tried to ride the viral Michele train when announcing that Joie Chavis and Trevon Diggs were expecting a child together. The popular gossip outlet announced Chavis' pregnancy by sharing a tweet comparing her to Michele. There is a 10-year age gap between Chavis and Diggs and a 17-year age gap between Michele and her partner, Jalen Green.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">However, fans were not here for the comparison. "10 is decent and she donâ€™t got no kids his age," one fan argued. "10 and 17 years are very different ðŸ˜…," added another. "25 and 35 is NOT news ðŸ˜•ðŸ˜’," noted a third. As seen in the examples, most people felt that Neighborhood Talk was simply trying to conflate an unrelated issue for clicks. Do you feel that the situations are different?
