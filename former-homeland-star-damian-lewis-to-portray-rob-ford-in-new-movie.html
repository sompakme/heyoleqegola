Tabloids were tipped of a video of Ford smoking crack, which eventually went viral and saw the politician make worldwide headlines.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">However, his crack smoking was just one piece of a bizarre puzzle, as Ford has also been caught arguing with employees whilst intoxicated, jiving to Bob Marley at work, spewing some particularly racist comments, as well as walking head-first into a news camera. All of these instances helped create a flawed yet fascinating portrait of politician that lacks traditional decorum when its comes to assuming a public and dignified role; Ford can be seen as a proto-Trump in that regard.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Damian Lewis, the actor most notable for his arch on Showtime series&nbsp;Homeland,&nbsp;has been cast as&nbsp;Rob Ford in the upcoming film Run This Town; although, the character will only play a minor role in the production. The film tells the story of a budding journalist and other millennials trying to succeed in a post-recession economy.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The director of the film Ricky Tollman&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">notes how</a> "this isnâ€™t the Rob Ford story, this is a story about people that I know and people I grew up with and a generation of people," revealing that a fictionalized Ford will only appear in "a few key scenes and a few key moments."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdhZYJ2hJFmnaiqnZq%2FbrTOppylmZ6ZerTAwKtknZmdnq6vecuerqKrXam8brzOq6urmaliv7CujJ%2Bmq5xdnrtuusSwZKanpp6ybrrEsKo%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
