Finance</a>, became increasingly and seriously ill. His parents took him to the emergency room, where doctors diagnosed him with Type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune disease in which the body stops making insulin, a hormone that helps the body convert food to energy and regulates blood sugar levels. "At that point, I was severely going into ketoacidosis," Michaels said. "Your body at that point is starting to shut down." He was immediately placed on a daily regimen of multiple <a href=#>insulin shots</a> and checking his blood sugar levels with a finger-sticking device.&nbsp;</p><p>The challenge for Michaels and managing diabetes is balance: If he takes too much insulin and his blood sugar drops, he can pass out. At a late '80s show at Madison Square Garden in New York, according to <a href=#>Spin</a>,&nbsp;Michaels didn't feel his blood sugar getting low, and he passed out on stage.</p><p>As Type 1 diabetes is a chronic condition with no cure, Michaels continues to deal with diabetes-related setbacks.&nbsp;In 2010, his daughter, <a href=#>Raine</a>, 10-years-old at the time, was diagnosed with pre-diabetes. And in 2018, he <a href=#>tweeted</a> that he'd been admitted to emergency rooms several times over the previous weeks because of diabetes-related kidney and heart issues. But the man gives back: In 2010, he won The Celebrity Apprentice and donated his $390,000 winnings to the American Diabetes Association.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2BlXJuaWlfqbWmedOrmKChk2K%2Fpq3LZqOinpViwLW70bJkqJ5dpbyqv86nZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
