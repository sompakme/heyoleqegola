If only there were a way to get a&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>blowout at home</a>&nbsp;— and without the heat damage, too. I knew I had some TikTok investigating to do, particularly as a lazy girl with a penchant for beauty hacks. Fast forward to stumbling across user&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>@mypawfectfamily</a>'s video of a heatless blowout trick that I knew I had to try.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After testing this technique, I'm happy to report that it quite literally changed the way I style my hair for good. So, if you're trying to cut down on heat styling or looking for ways to shorten your hairstyling routine (who isn't?), keep reading to learn more about this overnight blowout method and my honest thoughts throughout the process.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-youll-need></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What You'll Need</span></h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><li>T-shirt</li><li>Hair ties</li><li>Comb</li><li>Hairpins</li><li>Spray bottle with water</li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-process></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Process</span></h2><li><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Roll up a T-shirt</a>&nbsp;into a circular doughnut shape.</li><li><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Part your hair</a>&nbsp;(however you usually part it).</li><li>Use a fine, long-tail comb to create the first section of hair that will wrap around the T-shirt.&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>Start from the top of the head</a>&nbsp;and create a triangle section at the front.</li><li>Brush that hair to remove any knots or tangles, spray it with water (if it isn't already damp), and wrap it around the doughnut.</li><li>Once you're at the tail end of that section of hair, you grab more hair and repeat the process of wrapping it around the T-shirt.</li><li>When you're finished with one side, you'll secure the ends with a pin on the back of your head and repeat this process on the other side.</li><li>Finally, you'll sleep in this overnight, and when you wake up, you'll have an easy, beautiful hairstyle.</li><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: Brazilian Blowout vs. Keratin Treatment — Which One Should You Get?</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-results></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Results</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As someone with wavy hair that's&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>frizzy</a>, I recommend trying this at home. I followed the&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>original tutorial</a>&nbsp;and thought it was pretty easy to get my hair wrapped around the T-shirt doughnut. I was also pleasantly surprised that the T-shirt didn't feel uncomfortable as I went to lie down for bed.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When I first took out the T-shirt the next day, I admittedly was confused because my hair looked frizzy, unshapely, and nothing like how it did in the video. After finger-combing through my hair and fluffing it out, though, it helped reduce some of that initial frizz and define the curls and waves.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I proceeded to blow-dry my curtain bangs&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>to help shape them</a>&nbsp;(yes, I technically cheated, but those with bangs will understand) and added a small amount of&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>hair oil</a>&nbsp;to smooth everything out. As the day went on, the curls became looser, which I loved because it gave it that bouncy, blowout look.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-final-takeaway></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Final Takeaway</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Overall, I was super impressed by this heatless hair hack and have been talking about it non-stop to all of my friends and family, encouraging them to give it a try ever since trying it. I will say, though, I think this trick will work best for those with straight, wavy, or loose curls and a medium-to-long length. However, if you're like me and love experimenting with new beauty tips and tricks, I say definitely try it out.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZMGqt9OoomaglZbBrbHSrGSbpJ%2BsvLbAjKGYoqpdna6ktw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
