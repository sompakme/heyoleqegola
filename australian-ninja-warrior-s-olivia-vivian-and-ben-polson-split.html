They have since moved out of the rented home they shared in Perth.</p><p>The pair won the hearts of <i>Ninja Warrior</i> fans five years ago while competing on the much-loved reality TV program, and they fell in love soon after meeting at the Ninja Academy. Their first date was Perth’s Cottesloe Beach where they ate fish and chips and watched the sunset.</p><p>“You don’t go on a TV show like <i>Ninja Warrior </i>expecting to find love,” he told <i><a class=body-link href=#>New Idea</a></i> in 2021. “It really shows that you find love in the most unpredictable places.”</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>“We do have the bond of Ninja, but outside of that we don’t talk about the show all that much. We are just normal people – actually, we’re a bunch of weirdos,” he laughed, to which Olivia added: “We are just two goofballs. Ben makes me smile and laugh every day of the year. I am so grateful that Ninja brought us together – it changed my life.”</p><p>The pair have appeared on every season of <i>Ninja Warrior </i>since it premiered in Australia in 2017.</p><p>Ben took out the crown of Australia’s first Ninja Warrior in 2020 when he was able to climb the dreaded Mount Midoriyama, earning himself the $400,000 cash prize.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7xKernqqklravucSnq2ispmS%2Fpq3LoquyZaSrfKLB0q2pmqSZlrtuusinoZplp5a%2Fs7XOq6pmn5%2Bhsaa6jJymrqicmnqwuMivoJplpp7Dqq3NZpinnF2Xsq95z6ijrKeeYsCxuMitZJqepJq%2FbrLIr5xmsZWWv7R7zZ6urGWjqbyzxY6faGxok5aEpIKRnZhvcGBnhHJ%2Fwp1ta5loaYSkgpCabg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
