The nearly century-old stalwarts down the coast — Pacific Palisades' <span data-scayt_word=Bel data-scaytid=4>Bel</span><strong>–</strong>Air Bay Club and Santa Monica's The Beach Club (aka BC) and Jonathan Club — tend to welcome industry civilians of East Coast Ivy League stock but limit, for privacy reasons, celebrity presence. Would-be members can hear, "We're not really a Hollywood club," during the application process, which can take a year at Jonathan and two years at the BC as aspirants prove long-term ties to member families, answering questions like, "What's the view from their backyard?"</p><p><img decoding=async alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/sites/default/files/custom/Pat/THR-style-beach-EMBED.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Most beach clubs have strict rules barring members from talking with outsiders about the clubs. Initiation fees can be one-time or include equity shares — meaning they later can be sold at prices that fluctuate according to the number of memberships available — and run as high as $85,000, not including monthly user fees (Soho House membership simply requires an annual fee). Membership can include spas, pools, even a rare <span data-scayt_word=padel data-scaytid=5>padel</span> court (a paddle tennis/squash hybrid), but — most of all — buys access to a fully serviced stretch of sand leased by the club, only a minute's stroll away (below the median-tide point is public). The choice can come down to the commute, says an industry member: "Jonathan is the first off the 10 Freeway, which makes it convenient. <span data-scayt_word=Bel-Air data-scaytid=6>Bel-Air</span> Bay Club is farther down <span data-scayt_word=PCH data-scaytid=7>PCH</span>. Traffic gets bad in the summer — a quarter-mile can be 20 minutes."</p><p>Beach clubs also can serve as unique settings for work gatherings. After client Alicia <span data-scayt_word=Vikander data-scaytid=8>Vikander</span> won the supporting actress Oscar in February, <span data-scayt_word=UTA data-scaytid=10>UTA</span> partner Theresa Peters took <span data-scayt_word=Vikander data-scaytid=9>Vikander</span> and her team to Jonathan Beach Club. "Nobody bothered her," says Peters. "It's a nice break from the typical places everyone goes to for business."</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=11><h2>A.

Little Beach House is based at the Larry Ellison-owned Carbon Beach property that once housed Nikita restaurant and sits between <span data-scayt_word=Nobu data-scaytid=8>Nobu</span> Malibu and the new <span data-scayt_word=Nobu data-scaytid=9>Nobu</span> <span data-scayt_word=Ryokan data-scaytid=11>Ryokan</span> hotel. A large wooden pergola and an outdoor bar were added to the original terrace; the second floor houses three sitting areas that overlook the ocean, all decorated in the franchise's signature Brit-chic style. The strategy for membership (annual fees run about $2,000) currently focuses on locals and those with Malibu ties; existing Soho House members must apply to the Malibu outpost separately. For those who descend the ladder off the terrace to the sand (during low tide only), there are changing rooms and an outdoor shower ("if you're brave enough to use it," says an actress, noting its visibility to <span data-scayt_word=Nobu data-scaytid=10>Nobu</span> diners). Early reviews of the club with a much smaller footprint of 10,000 square feet (200 of that in beachfront) and about 10 additional miles of commute up <span data-scayt_word=PCH data-scaytid=12>PCH</span> generally are positive: "The place is amazing," says one member. "The question is how much it'll be used in the off-season."</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=19.5><h2>B.

The sprawling 14-acre estate, with a beach and an upper club but no pool, carries the priciest equity membership buy-in among L.A.'s beach clubs at about $85,000, plus $500 in monthly fees. The club was conceived by oil prospector and tennis champion <span data-scayt_word=Alphonzo data-scaytid=40>Alphonzo</span> Bell, who also developed L.A.'s <span data-scayt_word=Bel data-scaytid=41>Bel</span> Air neighborhood.</p><p>Stretched along a quarter-mile of beachfront (and located next to the popular Sunset surf break), <span data-scayt_word=Bel-Air data-scaytid=42>Bel-Air</span> Bay is known for its "90210 … summer-jobs" atmosphere and cabanas, which boast a wait list; as many as four families can be assigned to share a structure. Getting into a cabana is "a convoluted process," says a longtime member. A member of another club says it "is a little cliquish: 'My cabana is better, or better decorated, than yours,' or, 'You don't have one.' " But insiders feel, practically speaking, that "if you don't have a cabana, you don't have storage" (beyond gym lockers and <span data-scayt_word=paddleboard data-scaytid=44>paddleboard</span> storage). Paddle tennis is big at the club: "Some of these guys take it very seriously," says San Francisco-based producer Todd <span data-scayt_word=Traina data-scaytid=45>Traina</span> (<span data-scayt_word=Tallulah data-scaytid=46>Tallulah</span>), brought as a guest by industry pals upon moving to L.A. in 1991. "I spent summers in Newport, R.I., where I'd go to a beach club, so the <span data-scayt_word=Bel-Air data-scaytid=47>Bel-Air</span> Bay felt like home. The beach is big and beautiful. It was a good transition to L.A."</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=13.5><h2>C.

What began as a men's swimming club is "famously WASP-y" and tends to draw "East Coast traditionalists and finance types," says a local observer, adding, "Big celebs try to join and are often 'not invited' " (longtime member O'Donnell excepted). Equity buy-ins range from about $75,000 to $85,000 with monthly fees of about $500, plus food and beverage costs. The club lacks a pool, but those with ocean interests, from swimming to boogie boarding to stand-up <span data-scayt_word=paddleboarding data-scaytid=4>paddleboarding</span>, are welcome; beach volleyball legends <span data-scayt_word=Sinjin data-scaytid=7>Sinjin</span> Smith and <span data-scayt_word=Karch data-scaytid=8>Karch</span> <span data-scayt_word=Kiraly data-scaytid=9>Kiraly</span> (a three-time Olympic gold medalist) have trained on the club's courts. There also is a passionate paddle tennis scene, and the club claims one of L.A.'s few <span data-scayt_word=padel data-scaytid=10>padel</span> courts. Recent upgrades include a double bocce ball court and a Sky Bar featuring an adults-only deck that serves notoriously strong <span data-scayt_word=mai data-scaytid=13>mai</span> tais. The kids' summer camp is a major plus, as is beach-equipment storage. The dedicated staff is another asset, says a longtime member: "Cesar, who has worked there for 40-something years, mans the grill. He's an institution." Adds <span data-scayt_word=Woldenberg data-scaytid=15>Woldenberg</span>, "The Beach Club has the best fish tacos in L.A., period."</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=15><h2>D. Jonathan Beach Club</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/stephaniegodfrey-hr-h_2016.jpg><p>(Pictured: Revelers at a Jonathan Beach Club event.)</p><p><strong>FOUNDED</strong> 1927 (<span data-scayt_word=DTLA data-scaytid=1>DTLA</span>: 1894)</p><p><strong>WHO GOES</strong> <span data-scayt_word="UTA's" data-scaytid=2>UTA's</span> Theresa Peters, Chris Hart and Matt Rice; Management 360's <span data-scayt_word=Guymon data-scaytid=3>Guymon</span> <span data-scayt_word=Casady data-scaytid=6>Casady</span>; producer Marty Bowen; <span data-scayt_word="CAA's" data-scaytid=7>CAA's</span> Scott Greenberg and Craig Gering</p><p>At 3,600 strong, Jonathan Club has the largest membership, and all of its beach club members ("lots of attorneys and doctors," says one observer) also belong to its downtown club, with an initiation fee of about $45,000 plus monthly fees of about $500. The three-acre beach outpost is more button-down than the town club, though some old-school rules persist, including the following no-nos in the dining area: "clothing that exposes undergarments and bare midriffs, is excessively revealing or which might be considered offensive." Amenities include an indoor pool, a full-blown spa, assigned lockers, five paddle tennis courts and an athletic facility, which some industry members use as a daily gym. "Paddle tennis is tennis for <span data-scayt_word=nonathletes data-scaytid=9>nonathletes</span>," jokes one regular player, who says former WMA boss Jim <span data-scayt_word=Wiatt data-scaytid=10>Wiatt</span> practices the sport there daily. An outdoor kids' pool and child-friendly programs are a major reason to join, say members. "I love when I show up in the morning to play paddle tennis and see tents on the beach set up for father-son sleepovers," says an industry dad. "It's a family club — I don't go to shake hands." Bowen is a fan of the Sunday brunch buffet, which has "a deeper bench than Soho House's Sunday Feast," with bacon waffles a favorite. The downtown annex originally drew blue-blooded members from Pasadena and San Marino (the club blocked women and minorities from joining until the late <span data-scayt_word=1980s data-scaytid=11>1980s</span>), and the beach venue is populated by <span data-scayt_word=Westsiders data-scaytid=15>Westsiders</span>. Says one observer, "Jonathan Club got a lot of flack for exclusionary admittance policies in the past, but it has done a good job of bringing in people of color" and now counts 600 women among its primary members. These days the club makes best efforts to be eco- and community-friendly, sourcing greens from its <span data-scayt_word=DTLA data-scaytid=13>DTLA</span> venue's rooftop garden and supporting local environmental organizations like Heal the Bay.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=9.5><h2>Annenberg Community Beach House</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/gettyimages-583622484-h_2016.jpg><p><strong>FOUNDED </strong>2009</p><p><strong>WHO GOES</strong> Gwen Stefani, Sundance Film Festival director of programming Trevor <span data-scayt_word=Groth data-scaytid=1>Groth</span>, producer Danielle <span data-scayt_word=Renfrew data-scaytid=2>Renfrew</span></p><p>Open to the public, the <span data-scayt_word=Annenberg data-scaytid=6>Annenberg</span> sits between the private Beach Club to the north and the Jonathan Club to the south on the site of actress Marion Davies’ former <span data-scayt_word=1920s data-scaytid=8>1920s</span> <span data-scayt_word=beachside data-scaytid=9>beachside</span> mansion. The five-acre estate (developed with help from Davies’ longtime lover William Randolph Hearst and his Hearst Castle architect Julia Morgan) was an old Hollywood party pad during Santa Monica's Gold Coast heyday, with visitors from Greta <span data-scayt_word=Garbo data-scaytid=10>Garbo</span> and Clark Gable to Samuel <span data-scayt_word=Goldwyn data-scaytid=11>Goldwyn</span> and Louis B. Mayer. Today, Davies’ original pool with its black and white marble tiles and the guest house remains, reworked into a Gold <span data-scayt_word=LEED-certified data-scaytid=12>LEED-certified</span> modern iteration, funded by a $27.5 million <span data-scayt_word=Annenberg data-scaytid=7>Annenberg</span> Foundation grant. It’s popular with hip, low-key industry parents. Says one mom, it’s “a chic and accessible” alternative to L.A.’s private beach clubs, with clean bathrooms to hose down your kids. Says Sundance’s Trevor <span data-scayt_word=Groth data-scaytid=5>Groth</span>: “The best thing about it is the combination of pool, easy beach access, parking, cafe and kids' play area and splash pad.” The adjacent Back On The Beach Cafe serves salads, burgers, wine and beer to dine-in, or food and alcohol-free beverages for take-out. The cafe’s owner Fred <span data-scayt_word=Deni data-scaytid=14>Deni</span> remembers Brian Grazer would take meetings in the cafe when he was starting out in the biz. <span data-scayt_word=Paddleboards data-scaytid=15>Paddleboards</span> and large beach canopies can be rented. The facility’s manager Nan Friedman says the most popular days are $1 Splash Mondays when pool entry costs a buck, and adult-only Sunset Swims from 7-10 p.m. (upcoming dates: Aug. 12 and Sept. 9).</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8uiqq2rX567tLXDnmSlmaNir6atwqFknKSll3q0r8SnnGZxYW2BeYGO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
