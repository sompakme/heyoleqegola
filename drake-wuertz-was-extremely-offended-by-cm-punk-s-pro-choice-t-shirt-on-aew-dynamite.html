Wuertz has since <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">started campaign</a> to become a state legislature in Florida’s 30th District. Wuertz recently took great offense at what he believed was a walking advertisement for murder by CM Punk.</p><p>On <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">last night’s episode of AEW Dynamite</a>, Punk was on guest commentary for the bout between AEW World Champion Adam Page and Konosuke Takeshita. Punk was sporting a shirt with a pro-life message when he made his entrance.</p><p>Drake Wuertz took great offense to Punk’s stance in favor of reproductive health. Drake and other QAnon followers take anti-abortion activism to the extreme, often subscribing to the theory that a left-wing cabal of power brokers sexually violates, kills, and<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> drinks the blood of babies</a> to gain their essence. Drake was not a fan of Punk’s political statement, voicing his displeasure on social media.</p><p>“Liberal Athiest CM Punk promoting child sacrifice on a live Pro Wrestling show is disgraceful.</p><p>There is no “Right” to murder a baby.”</p><p>Drake Wuertz has repeatedly said that abortion is the biggest reason he is running for a legislature seat. Wuertz refers to the topic of abortion as a “medical freedom” issue. He also lumps anti-vaccination beliefs and other anti-public safety stances into the same basket.</p><p>The issue has been hotly debated recently as a leaked Supreme Court draft decision hints that the nation’s highest court intends to overturn the long-established federal right to an abortion. As a legislator, Drake Wuertz would endeavor to ban the practice completely in Florida. CM Punk believes in a woman’s right to choose.</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure><p><strong>What do you think of this story?
