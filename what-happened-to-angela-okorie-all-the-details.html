The attack on the singer came only a few days after a similar incident involving Blessing Okoro, who claimed that former Big Brother contestant, Tacha, was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">behind the attack</a>. Okoro and Angela are in a celebrity beef with Tacha.</p><p class=align-left><a id=https://www.ghanacelebrities.com/2019/12/14/angela-okorie-hospitalized-after-armed-men-attacked-her-and-shot-at-her-car-video/ href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Speaking about the incident</a>, the singer said that the attack was an attempt on her life, adding that ten bullets were pulled off her head with two more being removed from near her eyes. The renowned singer made a post on her Instagram page about the attack that took place in an undisclosed location. According to the actress, her assailants kept shooting at her for 30 minutes.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/643a10512594fff2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>BBNaija: Liquorose and 4 other Shine Ya Eye housemates who kept fans talking even after the show was over</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The singer has, however, not disclosed whether she had company during the attack. She then went ahead to post that whoever wanted her dead would end up dead themselves. On Sunday, 15th December, the singer uploaded a video clip of what seems an X-ray image of her skull.</p><p class=align-left>The singer's fans and well-wishers expressed their concern <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">after the incident</a>. Messages of goodwill for the singer continue to pour in on social media channels. Immediately after the incident, calls to the singer and her manager went unanswered. Okorie had posted on her Instagram page before the attack stating that <i>'When God is on your side, nothing fit do you'.</i></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/643a10512594fff2.jpg><h2>The beef with Big Brother's Tacha</h2><p class=align-left>Tacha Akide, one of the housemates in the recently-concluded Big Brother Naija 2019, has been at the center of an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">ongoing conflict</a> with Angela Okorie. The latter has been accusing Tacha of being ungrateful despite all the help received during the Big Brother contest. Okorie has accused Tacha of ignoring her calls after leaving the Big Brother house.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/8762d8cfafcca35a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Why we killed Army couple on their way for traditional wedding, militant speaks</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Tacha, on the other hand, responded by saying that her critics are not worth responding to. According to her, there should be some earnings from the publicity she would give those who are calling her out. She further asked her critics to seek attention elsewhere. Tacha comes into the picture after Blessing Okoro recently accused her of being behind her attack.</p><p class=align-left>The Nigerian entertainment industry is always abuzz with scandals and rows. This recent grisly incident involving Angela Okorie is quite disheartening. There are still a lot of missing pieces to the story, which will probably be unearthed after investigations. For now, we can only wish the singer a speedy recovery.</p><p></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfnOEk3BobGWnna61eceap6mdnpqxbq3NoJylmV2kuLC%2ByJ5knZ2klratv42hq6ak</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
