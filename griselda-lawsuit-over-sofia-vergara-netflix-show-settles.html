But he said he only became aware of the limited series “through news publications” later, and claimed Netflix used his narrative and other materials for the show without crediting or compensating him for it.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The suit reads that Michael’s (listed as Michael Sepulvedablanco in the complaint) “unreleased and private artistic literary work is used to depict the life story of himself and his mother, Griselda Blanco De Trujillo, in this limited series, Griselda … with no credit to [Michael] for his artistic literary work.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Vergara, who executive produced Griselda, and Netflix were two of seven defendants listed in the lawsuit. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/griselda-sofia-vergara-cocaine-godmother-netflix-1235807352/>When asked about the suit by THR</a> ahead of the series’ launch, executive producer Eric Newman, who was not a named defendant, had compared the claim to his experiences with Pablo Escobar’s children while making Netflix’s Narcos franchise. “The reality is that we’re a fictionalized account,” he said. “We’re not making a documentary; we’re not writing a book about Griselda [Blanco]. So, we’re not going to tell a story that’s going to make everybody happy or that people are going to say, ‘Oh, that’s exactly what happened.'”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOrKafoZFiw6a%2BxpqpmmWjmsG1uMSsZKWZp6jCqsCMp5ytnpyexW6z0aKqnqSUlnpyfpJub2tpZGh%2BcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
