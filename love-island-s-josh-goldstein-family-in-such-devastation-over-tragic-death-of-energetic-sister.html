She was a really funny, energetic young woman.&nbsp;</p><p>“As you get older people grow apart and see each other less, but every time we’d bump into each other at a bar it’d be that same enthusiastic energy.&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s a shame to see her family in such devastation. They are deeply in my prayers. It’s a tragic time. She was always high energy and soon to be married.”</p><p>As The Sun previously reported, a Massachusetts coroner’s office confirmed to The Sun that <a href=#>Lindsey’s cause of death is currently unknown</a>, as her autopsy and toxicology results are pending.&nbsp;</p><p>The coroner’s date of death is August 4.&nbsp;</p><p>A Massachusetts police department confirmed to The Sun that they responded to her home in Haverhill on August 4 for an alarm, but no medical was called to the address.&nbsp;</p><p>Her uncle captioned a photo of his beloved niece: “As some of you may be aware, I tragically & suddenly lost my niece, Lindsey Beth Goldstein, of Haverhill Ma, earlier this week. She was about to turn 28.&nbsp;</p><p>“Lindsey was a superstar who worked for the State of Ma., keeping children & families safe from abuse & neglect. She helped countless families in her short career.&nbsp;She was in the midst of planning her wedding.&nbsp;</p><p>"Please keep my brother, Marc Goldstein (RHS Class of 82), His wife Lynn, Josh, and her fiance Paul in your thoughts and prayers this week as they are not coping with this very well. She will be sorely missed.”</p><p>The Sun can confirm from an online wedding registry that Lindsey and her fiance, Paul Gorton, had a wedding date of October 1, 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>A friend posted on Facebook: "Lindsey Beth,&nbsp;the world lost an amazing person. Linds knew how to put a smile on anyone’s face and her contagious positivity and encouragement could move mountains.&nbsp;</p><p>“I am incredibly saddened to hear the news and I am thinking back to all of our good times in high school and in Keene. So many memories and adventures together. You were absolutely amazing and one of a kind. My heart goes out to the Goldstein family. Linds you will be extremely missed.”</p><p>Another friend wrote on social media: “Lindsey Beth I have no words for this devastating news. I am completely shook. Linds you were an absolute light in this world such a beautiful soul. You will be missed by us all.&nbsp;</p><p>“My heart goes out to your wonderful parents who always treated us as their own. To your brother and fiancé and everyone close to you. Fly high beautiful angel and watch over us all.”</p><p>On last night’s Love Island,&nbsp;<a href=#>contestants woke up and noticed Josh and Shannon were missing</a>&nbsp;from their bed.&nbsp;</p><p>The couple then walked in tear-stricken, as Josh said: “I just wanted to tell you guys that me and Shannon are going home today. Unfortunately, my sister passed away last night.&nbsp;</p><p>“She was an unbelievable person. She was the reason I am here. The reason I found Shannon and met all of you guys. It’s unexpected but she lived an unbelievable life. I just need to be home with my family right now to support them and I just want to let you guys know I am so grateful to have met all of you.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>“I consider you all my best friends. We’re going to see each other again. This isn’t it. I just need to be with my family right now and I really appreciate all you guys for the support and friendships and fun times and laughs. It’s been an unbelievable experience I’ll never forget.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Josh and Shannon were the power couple of the villa, as they were the only ones who have been together since the premiere.&nbsp;</p><p>Love Island's official Twitter account&nbsp;posted of the loss: "We send our love and condolences to Josh and his family from all of us at Love Island."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/08/0fc9a402-edc5-4709-ba23-4df1b165a4ed-1.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/08/NINTCHDBPICT000671442906-1.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/08/NINTCHDBPICT000671350844-3.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hrZGeEc36PaKOorpVitrS4wKebZqKfqLVus86lm6yslZ67brLApqClsV2Zsret0q2YraGfo3q0tdKtnKtlnJ67pb%2FEsmSdnZGptXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
