I’m 27 now and obviously look back and think how hard that must have been for mum but she understood as a teenager just how hard it would have been for me to see that and not be scared of that.”</p><p>Flash forward to 2016 and Mr Owen was writing and releasing his song <i>Proud</i> with Christine Anu. On January 21 this year, he released a modified cover of the John Denver’s <i>Sing Australia, </i>where he proudly sings “I am Aboriginal, and we play the didgeridoo”<i>.</i></p><p><span class=h3><b>Attending marches and events</b></span></p><p>Non-Indigenous people are invited to join Invasion Day/Survival Day marches and events that celebrate Indigenous culture.</p><p>“If you want to be inclusive of our community it would be lovely to attend one of the events that is happening in your community and you can find it on social media. You just have to search it,” said Minelle Creed, a Kalkadoon (Pitta Pitta) and Gunggari woman who works with First Nations-led not-for-profit Common Ground.</p><p>Ms Creed said educating the next younger generation was crucial and it was a great opportunity for children to learn about Indigenous culture and history.</p><p>“If you make a regular attendance at not necessarily a rally but a march that acknowledges the history of our people than I think that is perfect,” she said.</p><p>“You don’t have to walk in the march if you can’t but just going in there and standing around.</p><p>“When we normally do the march there’s so many people standing at the sides and on one hand they’re holding the Australian flag and on the other they’re holding the Aboriginal flag and that’s beautiful.”</p><p><span class=h3><b>Social media</b></span></p><p>Activist, model and influencer Fallon Gregory, a proud Nyul-Nyul woman with 27,000 Instagram followers, said posting Australia Day events and parties was discouraged.</p><p>“It shows support and lack of sensitivity,” she explained.</p><p>As for the actual parties themselves, Ms Gregory said while she can’t tell people what they can and can’t do with their time, if you’re partaking in an event or activity that is prideful and openly celebrating Australia Day, you’re celebrating the concept of Australia Day.</p><p>If you want to show your support for Indigenous Australians on January 26 through social media, Ms Gregory encourages people to share information about why you shouldn’t celebrate on that date.</p><p>“If you’re wanting to show true pressure and support then showing up (at marches) to provide numbers, posting and going live from the marches and rallies is key,” she said.</p><span class=title>Read related topics:</span><a class=topic_tag href=# data-tgev-container=story-topic-links data-tgev-label="change the date" data-tgev-order=1 data-tgev-metric=npv data-tgev=event10>Change the Date</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7y6Kdnqukrrmme9GemKVlnJ6zpnvNnq6sZZyes6Z7x6iuZqyfYrCmuMSbqZqslWLBqbGMmqysrKKWuaqtjJ2YsmWgqq%2BttcJmn6ikmZmuunnRnqqpnZOps7a4y7Jmp52nqHq0wM6rsGhoYW6FpoGXcJ2dm5GbfXiwxGtqapyUba93f5dwbZxqlg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
