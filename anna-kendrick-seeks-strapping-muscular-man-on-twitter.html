Anna's former Twilight co-star <a class=hm-link href=#>Kellan Lutz</a> sent a tongue-in-cheek reply to his friend, much to the delight of her followers. "Hi, I'm Anna, I'm alone tonight and I'm looking for a strapping muscular man to come over because butternut squash is hard to dice," 30-year-old Anna wrote on her account. "Hi Anna, What kind of knife do you have?" Kellan, 31, replied.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/68134e64fa9e-anna-kellan-a.jpg><p id=e-bni-osXxW data-wc=13><strong>Anna Kendrick received a message from Kellan Lutz in response to her tweet</strong></p><p id=e9885yMdoOu data-wc=128>Anna is currently preparing for the release of her latest film, Mike and Dave Need Wedding dates, in which she stars alongside Zac Efron, Adam DeVine and Aubrey Plaza.The comedy looks set to be a big hit for the star, whose film credits include Into The Woods, The Twilight Saga and Up in The Air, which earned her an Oscar nomination.Anna also has an impressive singing voice, as demonstrated in the likes of Pitch Perfect and the Broadway musical High Society, for which she received a Tony nod. But despite her wide-ranging success, the star admits she still gets nervous from time to time. She recently revealed one of the best pieces of advice she's ever been given came moments before she appeared on stage at the Oscars.</p><p id=eoIAoSrBq_JS data-wc=135>"I remember when I was getting ready to perform at the Oscars with Neil Patrick Harris, I ran into <a class=hm-link href=#>James Corden</a> from Into The Woods," she told Elle magazine last year. "I told him how nervous I was and he said, 'You have to enjoy yourself because the 13-year-old you would punch yourself if you didn't.'"I try to keep that in mind," she continued. "I think that's really great advice for everybody. To enjoy yourself in the good moments, and to push yourself in the hard moments. "So what's the secret to her success? Anna herself isn't sure. "So much of it is dumb luck and hard work and some kind of magical mixture of the two," she said. "If I had a secret to success, I'd make a lot of money writing a book about it."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8c3yQb2dsamlofXaFkGiYp6aRYrimusOroJyjXaCyrbjAp2SlraSverXDyK2rnqpf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
