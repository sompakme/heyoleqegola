The Duke of York, 59, issued a statement through Buckingham Palace after new footage emerged at the weekend allegedly showing him inside the disgraced financier's Manhattan mansion in 2010. The statement read: "The Duke of York has been appalled by the recent reports of Jeffrey Epstein's alleged crimes. His Royal Highness deplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1ecc17f22f5e-prince-andrew-1-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=ei88Q2zo6rJL data-wc=13><strong>Prince Andrew has said he is "appalled" by the allegations surrounding Jeffrey Epstein</strong></p><p id=ey08_R6BKVH8 data-wc=79>Mr Epstein, 66, took his own life earlier this month while waiting to go on trial for sex trafficking charges in New York. He had previously associated with the likes of Prince Andrew, <a class=hm-link href=#>President Donald Trump</a> and former US President <a class=hm-link href=#>Bill Clinton</a>. Police arrested him in July after he landed in New Jersey on his private jet. He had pled not guilty to sex trafficking and conspiracy charges, and was held without bail. If convicted, he faced up to 45 years in prison.</p><p id=eh1Zrqtu_nVz data-wc=1><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson arrive in Malaga for summer holiday</a></strong></p><p id=eRzwYgIEDP0u data-wc=68>The wealthy financier was held on similar charges back in 2008, but was given a controversial plea deal and instead pled guilty to the lesser change of soliciting a minor.

It is thought to have been filmed around the same time that the pair were famously photographed together in Central Park after Mr Epstein had served his 18-month prison sentence. Prince Andrew faced criticism for his friendship with the tycoon at the time, and he quit his job as UK trade envoy in 2011 as a result. He later acknowledged that their association had been a mistake.</p><p id=eXZ-LNIIsoAj data-wc=1>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Sarah Ferguson reveals what it's like living with Prince Andrew</a></p><p id=e-uqv8u5N-gu data-wc=36>Buckingham Palace has previously strenuously denied allegations made against the prince by Virginia Roberts.
