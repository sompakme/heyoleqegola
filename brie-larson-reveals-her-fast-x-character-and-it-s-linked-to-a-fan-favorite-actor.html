Per <a href=#>GamesRadar</a>, the Captain Marvel actress has finally revealed the identity of her mysterious new character as the child of Russell’s mysterious intelligence operative. While Larson is an Academy Award-winning actress, starring in action films is nothing new to Brie Larson, who is known for her roles in multiple Marvel movies, <a href=#>King Kong: Skull Island</a>, and Free Fire.</p><p>Brie Larson will join a whole host of big name appearances in the Fast and Furious movies. The franchise that started back in 2001 is known for featuring many stars, like Dwayne Johnson, John Cena, <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title="Charlize Theron" data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>Charlize Theron</a>, and Helen Mirren. Fast X will also add a new, hot villain to the mix: <a href=#>Jason Momoa</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Jason-Momoa-Fast-X-900x506.jpg><p>The last Fast and Furious movie, F9, left Mr. Nobody with an unclear fate after a plane crash in Montecito shortly after he captured Cipher (Charlize Theron). With Brie Larson entering the picture as Kurt Russell’s daughter, it is possible that we’re going to see an action-packed rescue mission.</p><p>But there are still a lot of questions about Brie Larson’s character. For instance, is she on good terms with her father, Mr. Nobody? How will she jive with the Toretto family? Can she drive? The answer to the last one is almost certainly “yes,” considering what franchise we are discussing here.</p><p>What we do know is that Fast X will star Jason Momoa as Dante, the son of the late drug kingpin, Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida, who you may remember from Fast Five), which we saw in the <a href=#>trailer</a>. <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title="Vin Diesel" data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>Vin Diesel</a> and his team will need to defend themselves against whatever revenge plan Dante has up his sleeves. Thankfully, it seems like they will have even more family members on their side, with Brie Larson and Kurt Russell.</p><p>This isn’t the first time Brie Larson and Kurt Russell have appeared in the same film franchise. The two have both made waves in the Marvel universe, with Brie Larson as Captain Marvel, and Kurt Russell as Ego, the father of Chris Pratt’s Star-Lord character. It will be fascinating to see how the two work together as a father-daughter duo.</p><p>Fast X will be released in theaters on May 19, 2023. For those who can’t get enough of the Fast and Furious franchise, there are already talks of an eleventh film, which promises to be epic, of course. However, that may be the last film in the franchise.</p><p>Luckily, there are plenty of opportunities for Fast and Furious spinoffs! In addition to 2019’s Hobbs & Shaw film and 2002’s Better Luck Tomorrow, we can expect at least one more. According to our&nbsp;<a href=#>trusted and proven</a>&nbsp;sources, Brie Larson will lead a new franchise <a href=#>spinoff</a>.</p><p>Not much is known about the <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=upcoming data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>upcoming</a> spinoff, but we can definitely expect lots of action, drama, and intense car chases. So, pay close attention to Brie Larson’s character, Tess, when you watch Fast X, because she’s not going anywhere.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2iaop6ybrjAq6qopl2gwrPAjKusrKuVoblur8eaqZqbpJq%2Fb7TTpqM%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
