As the daughter of Naughty By Nature's Treach and Salt-n-Pepa's Sandra "Pepa" Denton, Egypt has plenty of people looking out for her. The 21-year-old's romance with Sam has often been a point of contention with a few of her friends who don't believe that he has the purest of intentions.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Nevertheless, when Sam proposed, Egypt happily accepted. In a recent episode, the pair decided that it was time for Sam to live his truth so he made a&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">revelation to the cast that left many people floored</a> while at his engagement party. Sam was in the middle of performing when he sang the line, "I'm not straight but I'm not gay" which shocked a few of his friends.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In a speech, Sam spoke about his love for Egypt because she was the first woman he was honest about his past with. He said even after he told her about his two children and his "massive child support" during the first week that they met, Egypt didn't run from him. "Egypt was the first person that I ever told that I had experiences with a trans woman."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Eazy E's son Lil Eazy E said the news took him by surprise and he almost spit his drink out. Angela Simmons was "happy for Sam that he's being open and honest and vulnerable." Dame Dash's son <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Boogie</a> said he was "shocked" but "not surprised" because "Sam has an outrageous lifestyle." Vanessa Simmons wished them the best, but Egypt expressed <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">her main concern was how her father, who was in the audience</a>, was going to react.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p>About The Author</p><p>Erika Marie is a seasoned journalist, editor, and ghostwriter who works predominantly in the fields of music, spirituality, mental health advocacy, and social activism.
