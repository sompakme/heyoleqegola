Within the chat, the rapper referred to Azalea as a "great mom" who he loves despite their rocky past. "I'm single. She's single now. But that's one of the best mothers in the world. And that's what you got to put in the book, you hear me? I love her to death. She is the best mother in the world," Carti explained.</p><p dir=ltr>When asked whether Carti wanted to add anything to the end of the interview, he said he wanted readers to know "I love my baby mother. It definitely needs to be known that [Iggy] is the best mother in the world. My son is perfect. He's too perfect. I need to rough him up a little bit." Earlier in the chat, he stated he takes care of both Azalea and their son. However, judging by Azalea's reaction on Twitter, that doesn't seem to be the case, resulting in her telling her side of the situation. "Take care of me? Lmaooooo. Let's not get carried away now," she <a href=#>tweeted</a> before <a href=#>replying</a> to a fan with "I laughed. A lot."</p><p>After a fan of Carti's didn't appreciate Azalea's reaction to his kind words about her, Azalea <a href=#>clapped back</a> and insisted "saying nice things for an interview sounds great but in real life he talks to me like s*** so badly I had to stop all direct contact."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcWthbIB1e8ignrJlka%2BurbHArGSfnaWZeri106FkqaSRrq%2BwtYycmKusmWK1or%2BMn6OaqpWZera8jKilnJ1dlrSitc1o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
