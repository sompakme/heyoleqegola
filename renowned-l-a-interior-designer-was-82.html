She was 82.</p><p>Antin died March 4 of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease at her home in Los Angeles, her family announced.</p><p>Known for her passion for antiques, making furniture and designing, Antin once decorated an entire room in real time on Oprah Winfrey’s show, and her furniture was photographed in Brady and Bündchen’s house in Los Angeles for a 2017 cover of Architectural Digest.</p><p>Oprah also was a client, as was Jeffrey and Marilyn Katzenberg, Charlize Theron, Derek Jeter, Ted Sarandos and Nicole Avant, Natasha Wagner and many others.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>Her furniture also could be found in the homes of Gary Oldman, Ellen DeGeneres, Kendall Jenner, Sandra Bullock, Reese Witherspoon, Jennifer Aniston, Jack Black, Annette Bening, Justin Hurwitz, Paul McCartney, Lena Dunham, John Stamos, Sam Worthington, Justin Theroux, Sheryl and Rob Lowe, Minka Kelly and Ellen Pompeo.</p><p>She once owned a West Hollywood bungalow that was built in 1919, previously owned by actor George Peppard and recently put on the market by Dunham.</p><p>Born in London, Antin opened her first big showroom with her husband, Mike, on Beverly Boulevard in West Hollywood in 1990 and another store on Robertson Boulevard in 2017. Another store opened this month in a warehouse loft on Grand Avenue in downtown L.A.</p><p>As a creative executive at Motown Television, Antin read Larry McMurtry’s 1985 book Lonesome Down and thought it would make a great miniseries, and the CBS adaptation debuted four years later en route to winning seven Emmy Awards.&nbsp;She then changed careers after becoming disillusioned with the industry.</p><p>In addition to her husband — they were together for 66 years — survivors include her children, <a href=# rel=noopener>Steven</a>, an actor, writer, director and producer; Robin, creator of The Pussycat Dolls; Jonathan, a celebrity hairdresser who was featured on the Bravo reality series Blow Out; and Neil.</p><p>“Brenda is described by many as iconic,” her family wrote. “And that is indeed true. But she didn’t see herself that way at all. We told her for years that she has a huge impact onpeople — both professionally and personally — and she would laugh it off and say … ‘really???’ She was known for her singular taste and style, her store, her designs, her persona, her sharp wit, her great conversation [and] her volatile tongue.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8uinZ6rpK65pnvLop2eq6SuuaZ5zZ6urGeSp7KvsMBmmKesmaN6s7HNqK6nnZRitq%2FAxKugqKpdmbK0tcannKtlmaN6rbvSZpinn5WhsrR5w6KcrGWRqXp5foxtaG5oZGp%2FcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
