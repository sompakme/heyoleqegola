I moved out of London but still come back here to satisfy my craving for it."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mylondon.news/incoming/article26727118.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_IMG_8998.jpg><p>I struggled to choose between all their options; along with their best-selling options, they also let visitors choose their fillings, curries, and wraps. I settled for two of the best-sellers: the Bombay Royale and a King Korma for good measure.</p><p>The wraps were both built in front of me, with toppings generously piled onto a huge tortilla. They each got a turn in the hot grill before getting wrapped up in a tinfoil blanket and rested in their new paper bag home.</p><p>The £8.45 King Korma was first - I'd opted for a vegetarian version with paneer instead of meat, and the korma had soaked into the cheese on its journey. The spiced rice served as a wonderful vehicle for the saucy goodness, and the convenience of inhaling it in wrap-form made my day.</p><p>Sadly, there was slightly too much raw onion salad in the wrap. It threatened to overwhelm the fillings, and in some places it did.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mylondon.news/incoming/article26727115.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_293887dc-843b-4abe-8dd5-7d488517ac5aJPG.jpg><p>The £11.95 Bombay Royale was a different game entirely. The chicken tikka masala filling had soaked through the generous portion of chips within the wrap and its heat had melted the cheese into a moreish mess.</p><p>An added serving of fried paneer gave me extra creaminess, and the magical sauces on top tied the whole shebang together. The large size was more than enough for one very hungry woman - they certainly don't skimp on portion sizes.</p><p>Consider me a convert of odd fusion cuisines. I intend on returning to Bombay Burrito to try their entire menu, but I don't think I can ever leave without a Bombay Royale.</p><p><i>Find <a href=# rel=nofollow>Bombay Burrito</a> at 357 Goswell Rd., London EC1V 7JL or order on <a href=# rel=nofollow>Deliveroo</a> or <a href=# rel=nofollow>Uber Eats</a>.</i></p><p><b>Sign up to MyLondon's Going Out Out for the very best of what's going on in the city <a href=# rel=nofollow>here</a>.</b></p><p><b>READ NEXT:</b></p><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rsXLqKWdp55ju6bD0miuoZmkqHqwuo6rnK%2BhlazAcK7OppmasV2XwrO%2ByK2mZpmenLKtecyer6KbkaN6qrrDopinZWJrhHOClmln</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
