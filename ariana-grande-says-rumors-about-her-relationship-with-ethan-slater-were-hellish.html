(tabloids) don’t leave space for that.”</p><p>Grande went on to say that people usually leave that space “for their friends and family,” but “they turn it off when that aligns with the version of a person that they have in their head that they want to believe is true.”</p><p>In September of last year, Grande and her ex, Dalton Gomez,&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=nofollow data-url=https://people.com/ariana-grande-dalton-gomez-file-for-divorce-7566670 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>filed for divorce, People reported at the time. </a>&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/ariana-grande-estranged-husband-dalton-gomez-finalize-divorce/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>One month later, the couple's split was finalized</u></a>, Us Magazine reported.
