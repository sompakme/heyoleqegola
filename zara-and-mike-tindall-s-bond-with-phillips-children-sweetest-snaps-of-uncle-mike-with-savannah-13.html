Savannah</h2><p>It's safe to say that Zara couldn't get enough of her adorable niece Savannah in September 2017, when they headed to the Whatley Manor Horse Trials at Gatcombe Park in Stroud.</p><p>The daughter of Princess Anne was captured bending down to welcome in the biggest cuddle from the youngster.</p><img

rides</h2><p>In June 2017, Mike Tindall was spotted going full Uncle Mike when he gave Isla and Savannah a double piggy-back at the Maserati Royal Polo Trophy match during the Gloucestershire Festival of Polo at Beaufort Polo Club in Tetbury.</p><p>The trio appeared to be having a wonderful time as they made their way across the grass and in the heartwarming shot, which was taken with them facing away from the camera.&nbsp;</p><p>There is even a small glimpse of Mike and Savannah's joyous faces.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

didn't stop with piggy-back rides, Mike kindly kept the two little ones entertained and laughing by lifting them up with his feet.</p><p>More heartfelt photos from the Beaufort Polo Club in 2017 saw Mike continuing uncle duties as he was photographed carrying his niece Savannah sideways as she gripped onto his arm tightly and beaming from ear to ear.&nbsp;</p><p>The former athlete couldn't have looked happier in the snaps.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

Savannah the ropes</h2><p>The daughters of Peter and Autumn Phillips had their equestrian training started from a very young age thanks to their aunt Zara who could be seen enthusiastically pointing at the showjumping whilst attending the Gatcombe Horse Trials at Gatcombe Park in this photo from March 2012.&nbsp;</p><p>In the photo, little Savannah is being held by her loving auntie - and looked very enthralled by the display.<br></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

duties</h2><p>Zara Phillips was having a whale of a time playing with her niece Savannah at the Golden Metropolitan Polo Club Charity Cup polo match which took place at the Beaufort Polo Club, in 2012.</p><p>She was captured giggling away alongside her former sister-in-law, Autumn Phillips, who was sweetly holding Isla. Both Prince Harry and Prince William played at the exciting tournament.</p><p id=e5lyqloyWXj></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaKSorJiav26tzZ1km5mSrnx2fZRvbmxnqpa%2FonnAp5tmpZmgsm7AyKebmqScYq%2BwusNmrqKsmGK9qbXLpaCpq12Ytaq4w6ucp2WjrLKmwMSsq2arnpa9tHnOn2SuppOhsm65yKScZquRq66vusChZKKrnJZ8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
