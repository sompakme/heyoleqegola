Her life took a dramatic turn in 2008 when she was charged with the murder of her two-year-old daughter, Caylee.

The details of her early life are sketchy, and it’s unclear what her financial status was before the infamous case.</p><h2 id=the-trial-and-its-aftermath-DFcFhFlhnf>The Trial and Its Aftermath</h2><p>The trial of Casey Anthony was a media circus, with every detail of her life scrutinized. The legal fees and costs associated with the trial were substantial, and it’s believed that Anthony was left with significant debts. After her acquittal, she filed for bankruptcy in 2013, claiming nearly $800,000 in liabilities.</p><h3 id=legal-fees-and-debts-DFcFhFlhnf>Legal Fees and Debts</h3><p>Anthony’s legal fees were reported to be around $500,000. She also owed money to various other entities, including the IRS for unpaid taxes, and to the Orange County Sheriff’s Office for investigation costs. Her bankruptcy filing listed her total assets at less than $1,100.</p><h2 id=post-trial-life-and-income-sources-DFcFhFlhnf>Post-Trial Life and Income Sources</h2><p>After the trial, Anthony has largely stayed out of the public eye.

However, ongoing legal troubles and potential liabilities could also negatively impact her financial status.</p><h3 id=potential-income-sources-DFcFhFlhnf>Potential Income Sources</h3><p>As mentioned earlier, a book or movie deal could be a significant income source for Anthony. She could also potentially earn money from interviews or other media appearances. However, these are all speculative and depend on various factors.</p><h3 id=potential-liabilities-DFcFhFlhnf>Potential Liabilities</h3><p>On the other hand, Anthony’s potential liabilities include ongoing legal costs and potential damages from lawsuits.
