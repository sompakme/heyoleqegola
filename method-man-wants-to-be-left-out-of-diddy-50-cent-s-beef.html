In fact, since various sexual assault lawsuits have been brought forth against Diddy, things have only ramped up. Fif frequently <a href=# rel>takes aim at the Bad Boy Records founder</a> on social media, calling his sexuality into question and trolling him over his allegations.</p><p>Earlier this week, 50 Cent posted an old clip of <a href=# class=text-word rel>Method Man</a> speaking about <a href=# class=text-word rel>Kanye West</a>. In the clip, the New York native states that he hates Ye, even alleging that he once saw him at one of Diddy's parties "sucking d*ck in the bathroom." The insinuation didn't come as much of a surprise, as 50 Cent often references Diddy's <a href=# rel>infamous parties</a>. He also frequently emphasizes the questionable things that allegedly happen at them.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>Method Man's Daughter Claps Back After Raymonte Claims He'd "Hate To Be" His Wife</a></strong></p><span></span><p>"This has not been confirmed," he captioned the post. "But ya see why I stayed away from the man’s party’s WTF&nbsp;@bransoncognac&nbsp;@lecheminduroi." The unearthed footage managed to capture Method Man's attention, and the <a href=# class=text-word rel>Wu-Tang Clan</a> performer shared his take in the comments section. He claimed that the clip had been edited, also urging fans to view the full video on YouTube. According to him, <a href=# rel>he wants no part</a> in 50 Cent and Diddy's beef, and supporters can't blame him.</p><p>"This video fake 5.. you and Diddy <a href=# rel>keep me out of this sh*t,</a>" he wrote, also including a series of laughing emojis. "The real vid is on YouTube .. (method man bossip).. do your research .. yall fallin for the remix," he then added.
