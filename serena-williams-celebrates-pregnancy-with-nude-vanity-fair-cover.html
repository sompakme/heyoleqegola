Since then, she’s been showing off her growing baby bump <a href=#>on the red carpet</a> and via <span data-scayt_word=Instagram data-scaytid=2>Instagram</span>. Now she’s celebrating her pregnancy with a soon-to-be-iconic&nbsp;Vanity Fair cover, which was revealed Tuesday.&nbsp;</p><p>Williams stripped down for the magazine, revealing her baby bump a la <a href=# rel=nofollow>Demi Moore’s 1991 Vanity Fair cover</a>. The tennis star was photographed by none other than Annie <span data-scayt_word=Leibovitz data-scaytid=3>Leibovitz</span>, who also shot Moore back in the day.</p><p>In her cover story, Williams reveals that she met her <span data-scayt_word=fiancé data-scaytid=6>fiancé</span>, <span data-scayt_word=Reddit data-scaytid=7>Reddit</span> co-founder Alexis <span data-scayt_word=Ohanian data-scaytid=8>Ohanian</span>, in May 2015 in Rome after he sat next to her table by the pool.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>“This big guy comes and he just plops down at the table next to us, and I’m like, ‘Huh! All these tables and he’s sitting here?,'” Williams <a href=# rel=nofollow>told Vanity Fair</a>, adding that her Australian friend, Zane <span data-scayt_word=Haupt data-scaytid=11>Haupt</span>, pretended that there was a rat around to get <span data-scayt_word=Ohanian data-scaytid=9>Ohanian</span>&nbsp;to move. “He kind of refuses and he looks at us. And he’s like, ‘Is there really a rat here?'” To which Williams responded, “No, we just don’t want you sitting there. We’re going to use that table.” However, that only prompted <span data-scayt_word=Ohanian data-scaytid=10>Ohanian</span> to say, “I’m from Brooklyn. I see rats all the time.” Williams then invited him to sit with her friends and the rest, as they say, is history.</p><p>The couple will be getting married this fall, according to the glossy, after they welcome their first child together.</p><p>Though Williams’ sister, Venus, made it sound as though she would be&nbsp;<a href=#>having a girl</a>, Williams has since explained that she’s keeping the gender of her baby as a surprise for now.</p><p>“I think the surprise of knowing what you are going to have on that very special day you give birth is <span data-scayt_word=prob data-scaytid=14>prob</span> the best surprise you can ever have,” she <a href=#>wrote</a> in June.</p><p>Williams even <a href=# rel=nofollow>took to Twitter</a> on Tuesday to ask followers what they think she’s expecting: “[W]hat do u guys think boy or girl? I’m waiting to find out but would love to hear your thoughts.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnl5q7pr7ApWSnnaeofLSx0Z6lmmWnnrmttcCmqmablaGyo77ArZysZaCnsqi6wKeasmWeqrGmedWapaKsqWKzorXRZpqorpWnenJ8kHBnaXBf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
