The team is charged with leading CFJ’s mission to provide free legal support and advocacy to victims of genocide, unlawful imprisonment and other human rights abuses. The appointments are said to be driven by CFJ’s co-founders George and <a href=# id=auto-tag_amal-clooney data-tag=amal-clooney>Amal Clooney</a>, who have guided the foundation from inception seven years ago into an <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://cfj.org/ rel=nofollow>organization with influence</a> now in more than 40 countries.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“We believe CFJ now has the ideal executive team in place to lead it through its next chapter of growth,” said Amal Clooney in a statement. “CFJ is now a global legal support network which provides a beacon of hope for many victims of human rights abuses around the world. George and I are confident that our new executive team has the talent, experience and dynamism needed to grow the foundation’s operations and increase access to justice for victims of crimes against humanity around the world.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Lindsay will oversee CFJ’s justice programs, which include the Docket (prosecuting perpetrators of mass atrocities), TrialWatch (ensuring fair trials for the persecuted) and Waging Justice for Women (fighting injustice against women and girls).
