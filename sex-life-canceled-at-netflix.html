Showrunner Stacy Rukeyser, however, told The Hollywood Reporter that she didn’t view the last episode as the end of the series.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“The episode was never intended to be a series finale, that’s for sure,” <a href=#>Rukeyser told THR</a> a week after season two premiered. “I know there are always more stories to tell with these characters in the&nbsp;Sex/Life&nbsp;universe, and I hope we get the chance to tell those stories. It was important that we get to a meaningful place with each character this season.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Shahi also said in a podcast interview that she felt she <a href=#>“did not have the support”</a> on season two that she did on season one of Sex/Life. “It became a much different thing for me, and I’m not afraid to say that, she said on <a href=# rel=nofollow>Not Skinny But Not Fat</a>. I struggled with the material. … I mean, I’m never going to work for Netflix again now after saying all this. I just can’t lie.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">According to Netflix’s internal data, Sex/Life season two drew 126.8 million hours of viewing time globally from March 2-26 before falling out of the top 10 English-language series on the platform. That’s down about 45 percent from 232.79 million hours over a similar time frame for season one (Netflix began publicly releasing its top 10 lists the week after Sex/Life premiered).</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Shahi also called it a “bummer” that Demos had a <a href=#>scaled back role</a> in season two. <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Shahi and Demos</a>&nbsp;have been in a relationship since December 2020. “I think that’s what made Brad and Billie so popular was because people really felt the real sparks between us,” she said on the podcast, calling some of the storylines that did make it into season two “gimmicky.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Along with Shahi and Demos, Sex/Life stars Mike Vogel, Margaret Odette, Cleo Anthony and Darius Homayoun. The show is inspired by BB Easton’s book 44 Chapters About 4 Men; Rukeyser executive produces with J. Miles Dale and Jordan Hawley.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOrJyxZZyes6Z5wpqlnJ2cmrFuusStnaWhqGJ%2Bc3%2BUbG1yamdofA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
