While you'd think that means one has a bustling career and the other doesn't, the sad truth is pop music cares less about talent than youth, something nobody can conquer. So, after a couple hit albums, both girls petered out and found themselves struggling for relevancy.</p><p>While both still record music, much of their artistic output has been reality TV and cheesy B-movie schlock. Tiffany appears on shows like Celebrity Fit Club and Hulk Hogan's Celebrity Championship Wrestling (she was cut in Week 1, significantly reducing the chances of Tiffany ever main-eventing WrestleMania), and her movie career includes such gems as Mega Piranha and Mega Python vs. Gatoroid.
