"He was an adult. He co-owned and co-controlled the Joint Venture. This included his tour. Just as universities have little control over off-campus social activities, the FAE entities did not control or have the right to control Mr. Ahr’s personal life, including his drug use. The policy of preventing future harm factor weighs against imposing a duty, too. Mr. Ahr was an adult. He chose to take the drugs that killed him. Arm’s length business associates should not be strapped with a duty to protect each other from self-inflicted harm.”</p><p>Jacopo Raule/WireImage/Getty Images</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Womack accused members of her son's management team of providing him with drugs and allowing him to perform in a heavily-drugged state. Peep supposedly asked his managers several times to end the tour due to mental and physical exhaustion, but they pushed him to keep going out of fear of losing money. The lawsuit claims that one of his managers, Belinda Mercer, advised him to take an "excessive amount of Xanax" so insurance would cover cancellation costs due to illness. Womack also cited another incident when a manger gifted Peep with a bottle of pills for his birthday.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Despite these claims,&nbsp;Public Access Entertainment thinks they should not be held responsible&nbsp;“for her adult son’s risky behavior and unfortunate but self-inflicted demise.”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Read&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">our interview</a> with the directors of the documentary about Lil Peep,&nbsp;Everybody's Everything.&nbsp;</p><p>About The Author</p><p>&lt;b>Staff Writer&lt;/b> &lt;!--BR--> Noah's first interaction with hip-hop was in first grade when he bought Jay-Z's "The Blueprint,” which was quickly confiscated by his mother and replaced with Bow Wow's "Unleashed" as a compromise.
