After nailing a plethora of <a class=hm-link href=#>stellar ensembles at Couture week</a>, we thought she may have stopped there… but that was just the beginning.</p><p id=eFysU52LM4njW data-wc=31>Never one to shy away from the limelight, the Uncut Gems star donned major looks both on and off the runway, with a few pivotal moment’s she probably wants to forget.</p><p id=eokJoJLW8DMpw data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>New York Fashion Week: the 5 biggest trends from the AW23 runways</a></strong></p><p id=eHnPo0INnwML3 data-wc=77>ICYMI: Fans took to Twitter after Julia’s decision to walk in Alexander Wang’s first show since 2020 after the eponymous designer was accused of sexual assault. One user wrote: “Julia doesn’t walking for Alexander Wang go against everything you stand for???” to which she responded with: “2 b frank I love cancel culture but we do need to leave room for rehabilitation & for those who put in the work & heal & learn from their mistakes”.</p><p id=ewSA8YgS-ii8v data-wc=38>Despite the raised eyebrows and her <a class=hm-link href=#>runway slip up </a>last night walking for Queer British designer Luis De Javier, Julia kept her signature experimental style intact, giving sartorial fans what they came for with an epic line up of head-turning ‘lewks’.</p><p id=e_s6Dhw5WpFkO data-wc=6>Surely she’s too tired for<strong> <a class=hm-link href=#>London Fashion Week</a></strong>?</p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>Upcycled jean waistbands</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b1936b1f3243-jf8z-z.jpg><p id=eTDX0HuQG7BBX data-wc=69>Before the main event even began, Julia headed to a pre NYFW party in what we thought was going to be her wackiest denim look yet (read on to see how she closed the week…). This daring piece was constructed from jean waistbands, giving some major side-boob action. The one-shoulder ensemble was paired with denim sock boots and a patchwork jacket. Double denim just got a whole new meaning…</p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>Ice blonde</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3108cfe27f5f-jf7z-z.jpg><p id=eBYYnNJcOF1qn data-wc=43>Starting the week with one of her more ‘minimalist’ looks, Fox donned a metallic cropped jacket and mini skirt two piece, which gave the illusion of a jacket that was ripped in half, paired with furry calf high boots, and icy grey hair.</p><p id=ejYzZHQyF3vlg data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Alexa Chung wore a see through dress to New York Fashion Week</a></strong></p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>Black and Orange leather&nbsp;</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a59c5fe77b6b-jf6z-z.jpg><p id=eXaJN6d6IdiZ1 data-wc=34>She kept the ultra cropped top and major mini skirt agenda for this orange leather ensemble. The black and white fur trim jacket would have a 2023 Cruella De Vil begging for outfit ‘deets’.</p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>The eye patch</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1adf13cb9619-jf4z-z.jpg><p id=eTNwGwm6z3VQE data-wc=37>From this point on, her outfits only got more and more extravagant. To sit front from at the LaQuan Smith show, Fox wore a metallic sculpted bust under her black jumpsuit, paired with… a bionic eye patch.</p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>A bag of condoms</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/00a8a90042b1-jf5z-z.jpg><p id=e-DC99EWMvzCv data-wc=37>If you thought Julia wearing a white sheer dress with no bra and black underwear underneath was statement enough… you thought wrong. Why wouldn’t you accessorise a look like this with a transparent handbag full of condoms?</p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>Hell for leather</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/98d7817b8593-jf2z-z.jpg><p id=ec99_JcdP4kcx data-wc=95>There was no slowing down her crazy street style agenda, as this all-leather looked boasted so many signature details, it was hard to know where to start. The top half comprised of an ultra cropped jacket with a hood that made fashion favourite ‘underboob’ revealing, almost become ‘halfboob’. The bottom half consisted of a maxi leather skirt, with two cut-outs on the derriere, giving the 2022/23 trend a new makeover. The skirt also adorned a long animal tail, which she paired with a dog shaped handbag and black boots. Mr Tumnus but make it chic?</p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>The poodle dress and platforms</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8d4396c5bb6b-jf3z-z.jpg><p id=eXnbm5NYM3mLw data-wc=79>This outfit quite literally did what it says on the tin. Barbicore was on the agenda for the final day of her exhaustingly avant-garde week, as Julia donned a sequin pink bandeau dress adorned with… an applique white poodle that stretched from the bust area, down to her knee. Julia attended maximalist brand Wiederhoeft’s FW23 show in the poodle dress from its AW22 collection. She paired with sky high platform heels, adding major height to her 5ft 7 frame.</p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>Horn-clad denim</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/34651d764cc9-jf9z-z.jpg><p id=eRO_n3s-7YUd9 data-wc=80>We were surprised by this point in the week she didn’t look tired from serving major looks 24/7. For her last NYFW runway hurrah, wore the other contender for her wildest denim look yet, donning a bandeau bodycon dress featuring a corset style silhouette with faded panels, a raw-hem denim train and two large horns which protruded from the bust area of the statement piece. She wore her hair in her signature slicked-back style and her eyebrows were expectedly bleached.</p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>Pink Eyebrows</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/82bee4cf5ac8-julia1z-z.jpg><p id=epN2gSD7WTXfk data-wc=37>Somehow, Julia Fox is the only person who could serve a look that says ‘stayed at a guys house and I'm wearing his clothes home but don’t want to carry my heels’ and make it a vibe.</p><p id=ez8U85qRfxhz7 data-wc=75>She sat FROW at the Willy Chavvaria show wearing a netted jersey with no bra, leaving nothing to the imagination. She paired it with oversized retro basketball shorts that fell just below the knee, paired with black patent knee high boots. You thought that was it? No way. She eschewed her signature bleach blonde eyebrows and opted for barbiecore pink brows that were so thin, she could be mistaken for a supermodel in the 90s.&nbsp;</p><p id=ehwFhzPQoM-3M data-wc=14><strong>Like this story?<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Sign up to our Hello!
