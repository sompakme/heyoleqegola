One of their original formulas, the Lash Sensational, is still a cult favorite, despite coming out with other versions. Its curved brush with 10 layers of bristles creates a gorgeously lifted, fanned-out effect. I'm talking the kind of doe-eyed, defined lashes of your dreams. Even if you have straight stubby lashes, this mascara will have them lifted all day in just a single coat.</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Curling; Lifting; Defining; Volumizing; Available in waterproof formula; Comes in three shades.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> May clump with additional coats.</p><p><strong>Customer review:</strong> "I have long, straight eyelashes that fall flat with every mascara I've tried but this one keeps my lashes curled the whole day.

Its molded, tapered wand has 252 layered bristles of varying lengths so each one of your lashes is generously coated. Think of the brush as a comb for your lashes that lifts them up, up, and away. If you're looking for curled, over-the-top lashes, look no further than this Revlon pick. One Amazon reviewer even said it works just as well as high-end, pricier options.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Volumizing; Glossy finish; Lifts lashes; Dries fast.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons</strong>: Not as lengthening; May flake with all-day wear.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Customer review:</strong> "This is truly the best mascara. It doesn't clump or leave spidery lashes, and it doesn't smudge. It stays put, but comes of easily with micellar water. It's great for making your lashes thicker and longer.
