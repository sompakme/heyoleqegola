Buddy has a secret crush on his buddy and shares a kiss with him before Eric turns him down. That on-screen kiss is credited as being the first gay smooch on North American prime time TV, but audiences reportedly hated it. What would've been a potential recurring role was subsequently relegated to just one episode. It didn't hurt Gordon-Levitt's career much, but filming the scenes did leave a nasty taste in his mouth, so to speak. Asked about the kiss by <a href=#>The Advocate</a>, he said, "[Topher's] probably one the worst kissers I've ever kissed. You know, he's a dude, and girls are awesome to kiss, I gotta say."</p><p>Actor Laura Prepon, who plays Eric's long-time love interest on the show, echoed the kiss diss when she said on a radio show (via <a href=#>TMZ</a>) that her "Orange is the New Black" co-star, Taylor Schilling, gave better lip service than Grace.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbXFlaX9wsMCromarlZi%2FpsDSZpqaq6RihHG%2FjKyfqK9dqb%2BqscNmn6KclWQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
